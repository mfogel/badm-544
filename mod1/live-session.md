Strategy: Introduction. What is Strategy?

- me: a plan towards a goal?
- prof: involves
  - long term oriented (visionary)
  - top management-related
  - resource allocation
  - integrative and coordinated
- can occurr at many different levels in an org
  - HQ: where should we compete? (this course - corporate strategy, governance)
  - each biz unit: how do we compete? (this course - biz strategy)
  - each function within biz unit:
    - how do we implement our biz unit's strategy? (not covered in this course)

Mission, Vision & Values

- Defining (or revisiting) an organization's mission and values can be a
  powerful force for strategic management:
  - strong coherence
  - gives purpose to employees and stakeholders
  - helps to uncover / clarify critical issues

Strategic Planning

- Many organizations build on their mission and vision to engage in a process
  called strategic planning:
  - define short to medium term goals (10 / 5 / 3 / 1 years)
  - translated to divisional and functional goals
  - valuable for aligning goals throughout the organization
- ideally, we want strategic planning to be more deeply informed (e.g. the
  remaining topics in this course)

Business Models

Applying the VARS Framework

- V: Value Proposition
- A: Activities, Resources, Capabilities
- R: Revenue Model
- S: Scope of the Enterprise

Breakout: design a new apparel business model

- traditional:
  - two roles: designer and purchaser
    - sometimes in the same company - ex: Macys & in-house brand
    - often in different companies
    - working 9-12 months ahead of when the fashions land in the store
  - coordinate the whole Supply Chain
    - lots of raw material comes together, a factory
    - manufacture: usually where labor costs are low
    - shipped to retailer for sale
    - discounted inventory -> that which doesn't sell

Breakout format

- identify team spokesperson, use a google doc
- brainstorm an alternative apparel business model and settle on one idea
- sketch out some elects of the business model using VARS
- my answer
  - on-demand, custom fit clothing: user walks into store, gets full-body
    scaned, and is able to order clothing specifically made for their exact body
    then. Articles are then made locally and dispatched ASAP to the purchaser.
  - V: creates value by providing consumer with exact-fix clothing. Also
    goodwill from buy-local karma.
  - ARC: contracts with local manufacturing facilities, retail shops with
    full-body scanners
  - R: consumer will be charged per item, although only the first item will be
    full cost as subsequent items can be ordered without re-doing a full body
    scan, and hence without going in to the physical retail location
  - S: the enterprise is mainly the brand name and experience as the customer
    experiences it in the physical and online retail locations. Manufacturing,
    distribution is contracted out.
- prof highlights
  - renting of traditional clothing
    - use case: rent clothes for a traditional wedding. Have the opportunity to
      buy or rent it.
    - V: value proposition
      - reduces cost by allowing re-use of the clothes
      - more variety provided to customer at same cost
      - less space required in customer's closet
      - consumer values generating less waste
    - ARC: Activities, Resources, Capabilities
      - shipping clothes both directions
      - inventory
      - touch point(s) to customer: online (& physical?)
      - marketing, cost per customer acquisition
      - cleaning clothes between uses
      - fashion
      - insurance
    - R: Revenue model
      - subscription?
      - customer pays per-use?
      - a combo?
    - S: Scope of the Enterprise
      - just traditional clothes?
      - seasonal fashion?
      - manufacturing in house? cleaning? logistics?
      - target customers?

Business Model Viability and Pivots

Pivoting: When a business model is unviable, options:

- abandon: give up & fold
- or pivot: an alternative reformulation of the business model

Example: Stitch Fix business model

- they send you a box of clothes every month
- so you don't have to shop. Clothes fits you and your style
- started as a subscription model
- resource they developed in house:
  - an AI system that predicts what a customer will and won't like
- pivoted a bit recently:
  - relocated operations to lower costs
  - decreased stylist-to-algorithm ratio
  - added a customer purchase option: "Freestyle"
    - you can just buy clothes from them... no need to do the subscription
