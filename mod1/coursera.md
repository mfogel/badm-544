## 1-1: Mission, Vision & Values

### 1-1.1 Mission, Vision & Values

Mission

- a brief statement about company's ultimate goals and objectives are
- what's it's purpose in the world?
- google: organize the world's information and make it universally accessible
  and useful.

Why have a mission?

- (not all do, or not all have a formal mission statement)
- informs all stakeholders why the company exists
- helps resolve disputes about it's future direction
- inspiring for employees and managers

What makes a good mission?

- emphasize creation of customer or social value, not being the best or simply
  making money
- focus on important needs or problems to address, not products or services
- actually live and practice the mission in the company
- keep it short, inspiring and memorable

Vision

- not all companies define a vision statement
- an aspirational statement about the future direction and impact of a company
- google: to provide access to the world's information in one click
- unlike a mission statement, the vision statement may occasionally change
- includes strategic intent
- cannon vision statement: beat xerox

Values

- values laid down those at the company hold and expect others to adhere to
- a "code of conduct" for the company and its employees
- google: a set of ten core values
  - number 6 - You can make money without doing evil (aka: don't be evil)

### Executive Expertise: Mission and Values

How important is it for a company to have and live a mission? Why?

- Sean Chou:
  - implicit or explicit? Ok to be implicit, but everyone must be aligned, which
    is easier with explicit.
  - broad but not too braod
  - executive team needs to evangelize it, talk about it explicitly
- Kurt Bock
  - people need to know why the come to work in the morning
  - mission, vision, values and strategy - they must be connected. If they're
    not, the mission is nothing more than a poster on the wall.
  - each individuals objectives must roll up through the company's strategy, all
    the way up to the company's mission
- Al Goldstein
  - sincerity and transparency
  - a strong mission provides that

What's wrong with a mission statement that says "We're here to make money."?

- Kurt Bock
  - money is important and key
  - but purpose must be connected to a greater good, for employees and
    stakeholders to care about the company
  - vision: directional
  - mission: what you do every day
  - values: the guardrails
- Sean Chou
  - principles/values provide a guide on appropriate behaviors in order to
    achieve the mission

### Mission and Values: Role of Leadership

Do Mission, Vision & Values have a real impact on companies?

- formal statement say little about what is followed in practice
- ex: Enron's four values, right before it crashed from unethical behavior
- can be important for success, but only if
  - designed well
  - lived and practiced
  - constantly communicated by leaders
  - a true reflection of the ethos of the company

## 1-2: Business Model and Business Model Innovation

### 1-2.1 Introduction to Business Models

Why should we care about business models and business model innovation?

- examples of local businesses in Champaign that have disappeared over last 10
  years
  - two bookstores
  - an electronics store
  - a number of video stores
  - replaced by a goodwill, liquor stores, etc
  - why are liquor stores replacing these other stores?
    - no real competition from internet-based commercial for liquor stores
- creating unusual level/type of churn
- not just regular competition
  - blockbuster lost despite being really good at what it did, and all the
    resources it had

Are business models particularly important for business strategy today? Why?

- Kurt
  - Company Financial is employing and "at risk" business model, of dedicated
    representatives selling insurance to consumers
    - however, their business model relies on personal advice to consumers

What comprises a business model?

The VARS Model: Four main interrelated elements

- Value Proposition
- Activities, Resources, Capabilities
- Realization (Revenue model)
- Scope of Enterprise

### 1-2.2 The VARS Framework, Part 1

Value Proposition

- goal: increase economic value
- added (EVA - economic value added) relative to existing offerings
- drive a wedge between
  - value to customers
  - costs and risks incurred
- applied to netflix
  - watching videos at home
  - their recommendation system
  - cost reduction by avoiding local inventory requirements
- thinking of how this relates to EQ
  - with efficient use of a battery, we are creating value by
    - making electricity available when it is more acutely needed
    - allowing asset owner to extract more utility out of their asset

Activities, Resources, Capabilities

- key enablers
- how does the firm create EVA
- may be within the firm, or outside the firm but in it's value chain/network
  firm proper
- increasingly technology-enabled
  - but technology doesn't work in isolation
- applied to netflix
  - websites, web applications, recommendation system
  - streaming video support
  - netflix had to build direct relationships with movie/video producers
- applied to EQ
  - forecasts, scalable technology platform
  - relationships to asset owners, ISO's, sources of capital

Realization (Revenue Model)

- how do you convert EVA into a revenue stream?
  - sale of cash, credit or installments
  - sale of services
  - leasing or subscription options
- applied to netflix
  - the subscription model
- products and complements
  - the razor-blade model
    - sell the razor at low margin
    - then sell the blades at high margin
  - freemium model
    - sign up for free, get going
    - once the understand it, they'll want to upgrade to the paid service
  - two-sided markets
    - google & search & advertising
    - ebay
  - platforms & ecosystems
    - facebook: users, app developers, advertisers

Scope of the Enterprise

- three key dimensions
  - customer segments (ex: just female teenagers? or broad)
    - customization to each customer / segment
  - horizontal scope: how many products/services
    - which offerings?
    - what channels?
  - vertical scope: how much of the value chain is included within the company,
    how much kept outside?
    - can be critical in driving value and cost

### The VARS Framework, Part 2

What exactly is a business model?

- Sean
  - how does the company make revenues
  - how the company makes money, and how the expenses relate to that money
- Al
  - what your value proposition is for your consumers
  - ex: Avant - focused on providing solutions/products to middle-class
    consumers (in US: anyone under 100k income)

The VARS are highly interdependent: must be aligned

- parts
  - Activities, Resource, Capabilities
  - Revenue Model
  - Value Proposition
  - Scope of the Enterprise
- innovation in any of these can create a powerful new business model
- but the others must adapt and align with the new innovation

Tentative definition of a business model:

- "A pragmatic theory (or design) that explains how an enterprise generates and
  realizes (superior) value"
- It's a model, so it is:
  - a mental / abstract representation
  - a set of (testable) hypotheses
- something of an experiment
- what it is not:
  - detailed operational or tactical plans
  - a complete strategy for sustainable performance / competitive advantage
  - specific to a particular firm

## 1-3: Coherence, Fit, and SWOT

### 1-3.1: Coherence, Fit, and SWOT

Two core ideas in strategy

- coherence
- fit

Soccer

- team must work together well
- common understanding of strategy and approach

Strategic coherence

- first rule of strategy: strategy must be coherent
- a firm's strategy must be consistent and integrated across all parts of its
  organization

Strategic Fit

- align internal elements of the firm with its external environment
- from within the firm: values and goals, functions, resources & capabilities,
  systems & processes
- from the firm's environment: economic, political, social technological
  factors, competitors, customers, cooperators

SWOT Framework

- an early strategy framework
  - still widely used
- you want alignment between four parts:
  - strengths (internal)
  - weaknesses (internal)
  - opportunities (external)
  - threats (external)
- ex: applied to ExxonMobil

SWOT Framework drawbacks

- very high level analysis
  - very subjective
  - no guidance on what or how to analyze
- confusion about categories
  - perceived "threat" may be an opportunity
- no compelling connection to overall company performance
- so: generally only a starting point
  - useful for broad strokes, but not forming a strategic plan
