## Corporate Scope: Reaction-Interaction

Breakout: share last weeks corporate scope "reactions" and pick one, discuss

Individuals in class, what was your reaction on

- vertical integration: ~45%
- diversification: ~45%
- other: mix, geographic: ~10%

Discussion

- Berkshire Hathaway
  - student's thoughts
    - originally a textile manufacturing company
    - now one of the biggest diversified corporations in the US
  - prof's reaction
    - a collection of businesses without much managerial intervention
    - closer to a conglomerate than a business
    - many of the holdings are not 100% holdings, and Berkshire Hathaway doesn't
      interfere with day-to-day operations
- Ikea owning hotels
  - student's thoughts
    - 2014: Ikea starts Moxy hotels, partnership with Marriott
    - Ikea designed the furniture and hotel together
    - first hotel in Milan
    - now 3 different countries, over 100 locations
    - Was the start of the Marriott starting to bring in more networks of hotels
  - prof's thoughts
    - some synergy
    - ikea has expertise in designing furniture, able to deliver it
    - reach potential customer while they stay at their hotels
    - ikea designs the hotel, marriott runs the hotels
    - the alternative organizational form they could have adopted: ikea provides
      hotel furnishing to hotel companies They'd lose some control.
- Apple - semiconductor vertical integration
  - student's thoughts
    - 2008 Apple bought somebody related to chips?
  - prof's thoughts
    - Jobs vision: the world's largest startup
    - apple tended to outsource a lot of things to maintain that
    - 90's RISC consortium - ARM came out of that
    - Apple & Intel formed an alliance - early 2000's
      - Intel - vertically integrated: design & manufacturing
      - everyone else, including ARM: design, and then outsource manufacturing,
        primarily to TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation)
      - all iPhone chips Intel
      - while all Android chips were generally ARM
    - Intel no longer cutting edge, they lack the focus others have
    - TSMC now cutting edge for allowing more advanced chips

## Corporate Transactions

Corporate Transactions

- Ways to (sharply) change corporate scope
  - Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)
  - Alliances and Contracts
  - Divestitures (Sale, Carve-out, Spin-off)
- Compare with more "organic" alternatives like entry, gradual expansion,
  reducing investment, ext

Non-M&A Corporate Transactions

- Divestitures
  - Unit sales, spin-offs, carve-outs
  - implications for strategic focus, resources, innovation
    - overall:
      - increase strategic focus for parent company
      - conserving corporate resources of parent company (like head space of top
        management)
- Strategic alliances
  - Relational contracts, licensing, equity alliances, joint ventures
  - mutuality and conflict: partner selection, alliance structure, alliance
    management

Mergers & Acquisitions

- critical to ask if the diversification or vertical integration can create
  value (comparative organizational analysis)
- additionally, M&A transactions can involve frictions that destroy value
  (acquisition premium, integration, etc)
- underlying value fallacy (a common error):
  - "if I buy 20 acres of land in NY, I will be a billionaire" ... but only a
    billionaire can buy 20 acres of land in NY
  - right question would be "can I create more value with X than others can?"

Underlying Value Fallacy - takes many forms

- acquire a firm because it is a good business
- acquire a firm because you can capture its nice profits
- acquire a firm to eliminate the "middleman"
- a smidgeon of truth: more upside to synergies in a good business, but it's the
  synergies that are critical

M&A: Buying a Great Business: BIF: A popular cafe on campus

- initially contracted with Caribou Coffee
- BIF opened in 2008-09 (peak of recession)
- Expresso Royale steps up to take the contract
- one of ER's more successful locations!
- put out to big in 2020-21: Now Caf√© Kopi!

Valuation Exercise

- your firm wants to buy Expresso Royale in BIF (the jar of coins represents the
  business). ER has three business segments that you must value:
  - Quarters Quaffs: Quarters is a range of higher margin lunch menu options
  - Nickel Niceys: Nickels is a line of moderate margin speciality drinks made
    by a barista
  - Pennies Pourers: Pennies is a set of simple low margin "poured"
    easy-to-serve beverages
- info to value the business of ER
  - total volume of jar: 260 ml (includes air)
  - 1 mm of quarters: $0.2353
  - 1 mm of nickels: $0.0680
  - 1 mm of pennies: $0.0286
- estimate the value of the business in $ (x 10,000)
- example
  - 100ml for quarters, nothing else
  - 100ml x 0.2353 = $23.53 \* 10,000 = total value
- given your business valuation, decide your bidding strategy
- my valuation
  - 100 ml pennies: $2.86
  - 50 ml nickels: $6.80
  - 50 ml quarters: $23.53
  - total: $33.19 \* 10k = $330
- prof showed a jar of change, somehow I didn't see it! my revised valuation
  - air: 160ml (~60%)
  - 50ml quarters: $11.765
  - 25ml nickels: $1.7
  - 25ml pennies: $0.715
  - total: $14.18 \* 10k = $142k
- prof organizes a bidding war!
  - min bid of 170k
  - prof will give a hat if someone manages to buy the company without exceeding
    the actual value of the cafe
  - top bid comes out at $227!
  - I would have dropped one in there at $239 or something to scare everyone
    away
- prof highlights
  - in M&A, the target does not give you all the info
  - due diligence can uncover bad things - and unexpected good things
  - in M&A, the players generally have a lot of motivation to "get it done"
  - prof has never had to pay out the hat! 30x doing the auction
  - actual valuation from teams:
    - some below 170k
    - some in 220k, 240k
  - actual number: $19.35 in the jar, so $193,500 would accurate valuation of
    the business
  - if anyone with an accurate valuation of the business doesn't win the auction
  - Winner's Curse: so don't get into bidding wars for businesses!
  - keep your emotions in check, don't get over committed to the deal

What did we learn?

- winner's curse (the over-optimistic always "win")
- efficient markets wall (price ~= average estimate)
- emotion / motivation makes it worse

Key Takeaways

- the deck is stacked against M&As
  - expect with private information or synergies
  - but need to actually realize the synergies (stretch: get new capabilities
    from target, leverage: apply your capabilities to the target)
- therefore, a 3-part M&A test:
  - the combine business has valuable synergies
  - this value is not dissipated by the cost of acquisition
  - there is a strong, credible, post-merger plan
    - make sure the same person that leads the M&A must also lead the
      integration: avoid the principal-agent problem

Prof takeaway highlights from class

- synergies
- market efficient wall
- winner's curse
