## Introduction: Corporate Transactions

Agenda

- introduction
- mergers and acquisitions
- divestitures
- alliances and contracts
- a portfolio view

Corporate Strategy

- the pursuit of competitive advantage through the configuration and
  coordination of a company's multi-business activities
- involves decisions and actions about:
  - the scope of the firm
  - coordinating synergies across businesses
  - corporate transactions

Corporate transactions

- involve actions with other entities that change or manage the scope of the
  firm
- Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)
- Divestitures (Sale, Carve-out, Spin-out)
- Alliances and Contracts

Organic growth vs transactions

- companies can grow organically from within
- corporate transactions provide another, less incremental approach to changing
  scope
- always involves another firm; not unilateral

Corporate Transactions Resources

- BCG M&A Report (annual): Analysis and research different topics (not just M&A)
- Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)
- Thomson One / Securities Data Corporation: Data on M&A, divestitures and
  strategic alliances ($$)

## Mergers and Acquisitions Part 1

Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)

- Merger:
  - combining two companies
  - friendly approach; similar size
- Acquisition
  - purchase or takeover
  - can be friendly or unfriendly
  - hostile takeover
  - examples
    - Broadcom attempted takeover of Qualcomm
    - AMZ & Whole Foods
- boundary between Mergers and Acquisitions is quite fuzzy

Are M&A's Value-creating?

- acquirers need to pay a premium over the target's market value
  - value goes to the target shareholders
- impacts on the acquirers stock price
  - short-run: on average, neutral
  - lon-run: significant declines (on average)
- big examples of value destruction in M&A
  - AOL & Time Warner
  - Daimer Benz & Chrysler (more value destroyed that the value of the deal!)

Why do companies do M&As?

- good reasons
  - access to new markets, technologies, etc
  - superior acquisition & integration capabilities
  - overcome competitive disadvantages
- bad reasons
  - good for managers, not necessarily for shareholders (principal-agent
    problem)
    - reducing manager & company risk via diversification, but shareholders
      don't need the diversification at the company level
    - managers at the top generally get compensated by the overall size of the
      company
    - target company's managers may get a big stock option bonus through an M&A
  - managerial hubris
    - overconfident that an M&A will build an amazing company, huge synergies,
      etc

Why not just acquire good targets?

- Warren Buffett's strategy, works out really well for him
- but for us other mortals, we can't measure the true value of a company better
  than the market
- the "efficient market wall":
  - Investors (and other acquirers) impute the value of targets, which is
    reflected in the target's market value (stock price)
  - thus acquirers are only expected to make (risk adjusted) market rates of
    return from M&As
  - unless - the acquirer has some unique ability to see and generate value from
    the target

And it could be even worse: The Winner's Curse

- in a competitive bidding war (auction) the acquirer has to be the highest
  bidder to get the target
- to justify a high bid, the acquirer would typically have a more optimistic
  valuation of the target
- if potential acquirers get the valuation right on average, winning bidders
  would typically over-value the target

## Mergers and Acquisitions Part 2

Value creating M&As?

- often described as "synergies"
  - an advantage from combining two businesses
  - why related diversification is value-creating
- organizational capabilities play a key role

  - developing new capabilities: stretching
  - applying own capabilities: leveraging

- research:
  - M&As that don't include synergies on average kill a lot of value
  - M&As with stretching or leveraging create value

The Unique Case of Private Equity

- acquire, improve, sell
- highly leveraged
- how do private equity firms create value from the targets they acquire?
  - me: synergy: they bring managerial expertise to a target which lacks it
  - prof:
    - identify targets that are undervalued by the market
    - have a thesis about how the target's value can be improved (often bringing
      in better management)
      - this is a leveraging strategy
      - they are applying their own capability (management) to the target

Post-merger Challenges

- after M&A, firms often find that synergies don't materialize... because of:
  - poor evaluation and weak due diligence
  - weak integration plan (deal mentality)
  - taking on too much debt or risk
  - integration difficulties prevent the materialization of the expected
    synergies (by far the biggest cause of value loss, by 10x)
    - operational
    - organizational (cultural)

Interview:

- pitfalls for M&A?
  - Brett Conradt
    - taking things at face value
    - should dig for opportunities for improvement
    - stopping at the easy answer
    - not getting a number of different opinions
    - getting a bunch of opinions
    - parties involved are generally motivated to just get the deal done
  - Jamie Cleghorn
    - integrations are hard
    - have someone involved with skin in the game
    - those in charge of the M&A should be expected to stick with it and ensure
      it creates value
- ideas and theory about where value will be created - where from?
  - Brett Conradt
    - acquirer will have vision of where value will come from
    - target has a growth plan
    - outside consultant there to gut check thus ideas
- post-merger integration challenges?
  - Jamie Cleghorn
    - key issue: focus
    - best mergers have a short, clear focus of where the value will come from
    - integration thesis/plan must directly follow that path to value
    - 80% of the energy needs to go to the right 20%
    - M&A itself is a skill, takes practice

Most important for managers in an M&A

- avoid a deal-making mentality
- focus on evaluating the target
- ensuring the synergies are there
- planning for post-merger integration
- faithfully executing integration plans

## Mergers and Acquisitions Part 3

Main reasons for doing M&A's

- increase market power
- overcome entry barriers
- cost of new product development
- increased speed to market
- lower risk compared to developing new products
- increased diversification
- avoid excessive competition

Main challenges for realizing value form M&A

- integration difficulties
- inadequate evaluation of target
- large or extraordinary debt
- inability to achieve synergy
- too much diversification
- avoid excessive competition
- too large

A three-part test for M&As

- firms should only engage in an M&A if:
  - the combined businesses have the potential for valuable synergies
  - the value is not dissipated by the cost of acquisition
  - there is a strong, credible, post-merger plan for realizing the synergies

Attributes of successful M&As

- complementary resources and capabilities
  - stretching / leveraging synergies
- objective evaluation and bidding
  - avoid overpaying; ready for implementation
- maintain financial slack
  - leverage may be good, but avoid cash crunch
- well-managed implementation plan
  - identify right managers; include target views

Interview: Mark Moran - John Deer

- why does john deer do M&A?
  - most successful: when acquired something "far from home" (either technology
    or geography)
  - technology that's far enough from your center, but not too far
  - geography that you can work in, but you haven't yet

## Divestitures

Divestitures

- transactions that break up and separate a business unit from a compnay
  - not selling assets of a business
  - spin (split) offs, carve outs, unit sales

Divestiture Modes

- spin off: separation of a business unit from a parent company, where shares of
  the unit are distributed pro rata to the parent's shareholders
- split off: similar to spin off, expect parent's shareholders may exchange
  parent's shares for that of the unit
- carve out: partial sale of a business unit's shares to investors (parent
  typically retains control >50% shares)
- unit sale: sale of a business unit to another firm, including private equity
  firms

Spin offs from ITT

- ITT spun off xylem & exelis, thus they distributed shares of xylem and exelis
  to their own shareholders

Value create in divestitures

- spin-offs: ~2.5% value creation on average
- unit sales: ~1.3% value creation
- carve outs: ~1.3% value creation

Divestiture mode characteristics

- unit sales
  - fastest to do
  - smaller units
  - most common
  - profits go to parent firm
- carve outs
  - slowest
  - average sale of 20% of equity
  - profits go to parent firm
- spin outs
  - largest units
  - profits go to shareholders

Reasons for divestitures

- why might a firm wish to divest a unit?
- my reasons
  - get rid of unrelated diversification
- prof reasons
  - raise cash for parent (only carve outs and unit sales)
  - get rid of low profitability unit, focus on good units
  - reduce risk or liability (unit has exposure to lawsuits, damages)
  - lack of strategic fit (low synergies)
  - refocus on core business(es) (parent)
  - free up and redeploy resources / capabilities
  - free up entrepreneurial / innovative potential (unit)
- example: Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center)
  - remarkable in innovation
  - invented GUI, mouse, laser printer, bitmap
  - early version of the internet 1979
  - Xerox never successfully commercialized these! Other companies made billions
  - 35 projects spun off, 11 succeeded with combined market value of 2x Xerox
  - why? Xerox headquarters was back in Rochester, NY. Didn't appreciate the
    value of these innovations
  - freeing units from the parent company constraints allowed them to succeed
  - one key reason is the freedom to pursue new business models

Divestitures and Innovation

- research by Sandra Corredor
- innovation increases after divestiture
- especially spin-offs, as they set the unit totally free of a parent

How to manage divestitures?

- be open to divesting units, actively evaluate them
- be clear about the goals of any given divestiture
- identify the right divestiture mode
- ensure units (and parent firms) have the right resources (or the rights to
  resources)
- pay attention to post-divestiture governance mechanisms (leadership, board,
  cultural reset, ...)

## Strategic Alliances

A Spectrum of Organizational Modes

- better adaptation <-> better coordination
- less integrated <-> more integrated
- M&A: create full integration
- Divestitures: create independent firms
- what about everything in the middle? Strategic Alliances
  - alternatives to full integration, full separation

Strategic Alliance Types

- relational contract: long-term contract for services or products from another
  company
- licensing: contractual arrangement for access to technology, typically in
  exchange for royalties
- equity alliance: strategic alliance where at least one firm invests in the
  other
- joint venture: strategic alliance that establishes a new separate legal entity
  that firms co-invest in

Why do firms do strategic alliances

- accessing capabilities or markets more quickly (and surely)
- reducing asset commitment and increasing flexibility
- learning from partner; upgrading own resources
- sharing costs and risks (also rewards)
- building cooperation around a common standard

Microsoft - AT&T Alliance

- technologies to share: cloud, AI, and 5G

Problems with strategic alliances

- competitors gain access to capability, technology, markets (learning races)
- managing joint investments, risks, responses
- conflict, opportunism, disputes
- these problems can be also categorized the types of transaction costs
  - adverse selection problems (partner, contributions)
  - moral hazard (monitoring)
  - hold-up (renegotiation)

Making alliances work

- partner selection
- alliance structure
- managing alliances

What do good partners look like?

- bad: rowing a boat with a Rhino in it
- good
  - help all participants advance their strategic goals
  - have complementary assets (create value); seek different benefits (reduce
    conflict)
  - contribute valuable assets to the alliance
  - accept a fair distribution of benefits
- do your homework, research potential partners!

Alliance structure

- two broad approaches
- contractual terms:
  - purchase / supply terms, warranties, milestones, fees / royalties,
    technology grant-backs
  - specific conditions
  - you expect both sides to meet these terms, and if not, you go to court
  - works when you have specific goals to meet, no need to adapt to changing
    conditions
- credible commitments:
  - "hostages", equity stakes, sunk investments, exclusivity
  - general conditions
  - ensure both sides will be behave in the expected way, even if circumstances
    change
  - "self-enforcing contract"
  - examples:
    - king looses a war, offers a prince as a hostage
    - dealer must provide a deposit with a manufacturer to sell their stuff

Alliances: ways to manage risk, opportunism, conflict

- walling off key technology
- contractual safeguards
- seeking credible commitments
- agreements and governance

Managing alliances

- a good alliance structure works well if the future of the alliance is largely
  predictable. Rarely the case.
- relational governance: informal trust, reciprocity, joint actions, and
  convergent expectations supported by reputations and repeated interaction
- easier if you have the right partner and a good structure in place
- build and reinforce trust
- learn from your partner
- adapt structure and management over time
  - does the alliance still provide strategic overlap?
  - do the partners still contribute valuable assets?
  - are safeguards are relational trust still in place?
  - adapt alliance or exit?

## A Portfolio View

Variety of corporate transactions

- companies commonly engage in multiple corporate transactions
- important to consider interdependencies
- modify and deploy the corporate resource base

Intertemporal effects

- learning and capability augmentation
- creating and freeing-up redeployable resources
- inter-unit resource re-deployment (ex: acqua-hire)
- example: Google purchased Android in 2005
  - key employees moved over to Google, and took up key roles
  - google later formed alliances with device manufactures, to commercialize
    andriod
  - google later purchased motorola, then later divested most of it
- real options for future transactions
  - like a financial option, but with real resources
  - examples:
    - company A makes an investment in company B
    - google ventures, etc
- corporate transaction capabilities
  - built up practice on doing these transactions

Contemporaneous effects

- complementarities or synergies or resource re-deployment opportunities (e.g.
  between M&As, or alliance + M&A)
- inter-organizational networks alliance networks (also divestitures)

Conclusions

- corporate transactions are a critical dimension of corporate strategy
- M&As, divestitures, and strategic alliances
- M&As often destroy value; apply three-part test for value-creating M&As
- divestitures and alliances create value if managed well
- a portfolio view of corporate transactions is helpful

## Jamie Cleghorn Interview

- Management Consultant from Bain & Company
- elements of value framework
  - thesis: companies exist to create customer value
  - value proposition is discrete and measurable
  - 30 parts of any consumer value proposition
  - 36 parts of any B2B value proposition
  - a systematic way to think about value
  - useful for CEO's, marketers, product owners & managers
  - used in innovation: how to create a next-generation value proposition?
  - creates a vocabulary for sales people
- creating lasting change in organizations
  - fundamental belief: companies don't change. people do.
  - have to go one-by-one in a company and getting each key individual to change
  - recognizing that the change process is generally unwelcome, give them the
    time and space to internalize it
  - create the vision of the preferred future - the "beach" (or as I would think
    of it, the green grass on the faraway hill)
    - tell the story in a robust way so different types of learners absorb it
    - data learners, visual learners, spacial learners
  - as a leader, if you're not tired of communicating the change, you haven't
    communicated it enough
  - ratio of new info to old needs to be 3:1. Needs to be truely overwhelming.
- post-merger integration challenges, realizing expected synergies
  - key issue: focus
  - best mergers done with a very clear thesis of where the value will come from
  - integration activities must follow that thesis
  - M&A itself is a skill, so those who do it a lot get good
  - those pushing the M&A should be those who will benefit from it being
    successful and also those in charge of the integration

## Brett Conradt Interview

- Stacks Consulting, Managing director

  - don't stop at the easy answer, test your assumptions
- parties motivation involved in transactions
  - investment bank, target, PE fund
  - everyone's incentivized to get the deal done ASAP
  - make sure to report bad news, facts that negatively impact the deal, if they
    exist - even if nobody wants to hear it
