## Corporate Transactions: Walt Disney Case

Breakout

- should Walt Disney corp change course from its "growth by acquisition"
  corporate strategy? Why or why not? Consider:
  - what are the benefits and costs/risks of Disney's growth by acquisition
    strategy?
  - what is the alternative strategy if Disney were to choose a different path?
- prof polls:
  - as a movie consumer, do you like what Disney has done with Pixar?
    - me: no
    - class: 66%: yes
  - as a movie consumer, do you like what Disney has done with Marvel?
    - me: no idea
    - class: slightly more positive than pixar
  - as a movie consumer, do you like what Disney has done with Star Wars?
    - me: no
    - class: <50% yes
- class answers: growth by acquisition good for long-range prospects?
  - lots of risk to continue with acquisitions, another alternative: joint
    alliances
  - is Disney saturated? As in there's not really anyone left in their space to
    acquire that would add value?
  - focus on the core of what Disney is
  - form strategic alliances first
  - more synergies left to develop within the existing business units: ex
    streaming side more is available, hasn't been developed
  - changing business environment/landscape, especially in the streaming
    business,
- prof vs prof debate
  - continue with current strategy
    - It's working
    - if all the existing targets were partners, each would want to renegociate
      continuously, and suck value out of the alliance
    - leaking of IP: can't go partner with the 3rd parties
    - Disney's brand so powerful it can power so many different monetization
      channels via all the targets
    - leveraging capabilities across all the targets
    - leverage data of consumers across all the targets
    - streaming: content is king. In order to compete quickly and stretch
      capabilities, need to acquire
      - too much content - consumer moving toward familiar content and brands
        (like Disney)
    - Disney reputation for high quality corporate governance
    - Disney very good at acquisitions, done well in the past, if anyone can do
      it successfully in the future they can
  - time for a change: move to different strategy
    - leveraging brand, so many different channels to consumers
    - alternative to acquisitions? Partnering
    - the challenge: your partners may get more and more bargaining power via
      the hold-up problem
    - to beat the challenge - you need to create great content yourself to
      compete with your partner
    - leveraging and stretching capabilities by acquisition made sense in some
      cases in the past 15 years
      - but is it good moving forward?
    - Disney may be over-extending itself, and the core of Disney may be
      unraveling
      - Ex: star wars acquisition, and how that killed value
      - Disney: rinse and repeat of storylines gets old
      - Disney: is unable to move quickly to new trends, and by acquiring
        targets inherently slows them down as well
    - if partnering, and a partner doesn't keep up - give up on them! Hard to do
      that if it's your own division
    - to reassess: should look outside of Disney and understand what's changing
      in the markets and where there going?
    - why did they acquire ESPN? Where's the synergy there?
    - need to re-invent themselves before somebody else does it for them
  - class winner: time for a change!

## Global Strategies

Globalization as a Backdrop

- what about de-globalization?
  - what are the causes? Political backlash, destruction of institutions
  - what remains? Low costs of trade, communication, internet, travel, merging
    markets' support
  - whare are the implications of de-globalization? Simplify global supply
    chains, remote work, otherwise unclear
- various waves of globalization & de-globalization throughout history
- current wave:
  - WWII -> about 5 years ago
  - last 5 years: de-globalization
  - covid, trump, Russia invasion of Ukraine
  - but the technological forces that have been pushing globalization still
    exist and are still getting stronger and stronger, so it's probably
    something of a temporary dip
- globalization trade-off: countries give up a bit of their sovereignty, and in
  exchange get access to so many markets and the associated economic boost
- WWII: came on the backend of a decade of world depression

Global Strategy "Problems"

- Market Entry Mode: how should a company enter a foreign "market"?
- Diamond Model: What determines a country's national competitive advantage?
- MNE Strategies: How should a multinational derive a competitive advantage from
  its international operations?

Netflix and Global Strategy

- a nice example to work with, since we are all familiar with the product and
  what a hypothetical consumer might look for
- and yet, media/entertainment is a global industry with many local variations
  and challenges

Breakout

- identify a country / region for Netflix to "enter". Why? What is the
  motivation for Netflix to enter?
- what entry mode should Netflix use? Why
  - exporting, licensing (franchising), strategic alliance, joint venture, or
    wholly-owned subsidiary?
- What MNE strategy do you recommend for Netflix?
  - international, localization, global (low cost) or transnational strategy?
- my answers
  - Nigeria (quickly growing, should be a huge market in a few decades)
  - should do it to access the market
  - entry mode: wholly-owned subsidiary
  - MNE: localization
- prof polls
  - where should they enter? Mostly south & southeast asia, east asia
  - why should they enter? Access the market, overwhelming
  - entry mode: a mix of strategic alliances, joint ventures
- prof calls on teams

  - India:
    - market is huge and growing, # of people and affluence
    - joint venture to partner with the bollywood companies
    - pre-existing media companies from bollywood
    - possible to export content (created in partnership with bollywood) out of
      India
    - strategic alliance to use pre-existing bollywood companies, and
      region-based content
    - internet access growing rapidly
    - less internet censorship than the other big market: china
    - fully-owned subsidiary for more control
  - China
    - market is huge and growing, # of people and affluence
    - get access to market
    - strategic alliance: need a local partner but a wholly-owned subsidiary may
      be hard to do with China's restrictions
    - localization: need to have specific content to the market
    - political issues with government control
    - transnational: need to be aggressive on the costs as well as being
      responsive to the local market's taste for content

- prof key points
  - India:
    - is Netflix just a platform? Does the content just come from anyone that's
      local or do they need strong control?
    - Netflix has struggled in Indian market, possibly due to not enough local
      knowledge. Need deep understanding of the customer, what content will
      speak to them.
  - China
    - media in China is quite sensitive, so joint venture or strategic alliance
      may make the most sense
  - infrastructure in India & China both there/nearly there for Netflix to
    expand in
  - half of humanity lives in India/China/South-east Asia: huge opportunity for
    growth
  - Netflix:
    - tech backbone can be used in many different markets. Deliveries low cost
      across their markets
    - media: huge local variation. Definitely requires differentiation for
      different markets

Takeaways

- globalization
- localization
- joint venture
- MNE strategies
- different entry modes
