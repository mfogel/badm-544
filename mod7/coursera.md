## Globalization

Agenda

- Globalization
- Foreign Market Entry
- National Origins of Competitive Advantage
- MNE Strategies (Multi-National Enterprises)

Globalization

- a process of closer integration and exchange between countries and peoples
  worldwide
- economic globalization focuses on trade, investment flows, movement of labor,
  and multinational firms

Globalization: Trade as Share of World GDP

- 1910: ~25%
- 1940: ~15%
- 1960: ~20%
- 1980: ~40%
- 2000: ~55%

Globalization: Foreign Direct Investment

- investment in productive assets
- 1970: ~10B
- 1990: ~200B
- 2010: ~1.5T

Causes of Globalization

- advanced telecommunications
- reduced transportation costs
  - containers, multi-modal logistics
  - cost of freight fallen by ~80% since 1940
- falling trade and investment barriers

  - average US tariff rates
    - 1940: 15-40%
    - 1970: 5-10%
    - 2010: 2-5%
  - exports as a share of gdp
    - developing world has in general embraced the open world economy

- growth of MNEs and FDI

MNEs and FDI

- Multinational Enterprises (MNEs)
  - conduct operations in at least two countries
  - procurement, production, or sale/distribution
  - <1% of firms, employ 19% of US workforce
  - 74% of private sector R&D spending
- Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
  - investments in "productive" activities abroad
  - contrast with foreign portfolio investments (FPI)
    - FPI example: you buy stock in a foreign company
    - FDI example: a company builds a factory in a foreign country

## Foreign Market Entry Part 1

The Global Firm and Global Strategy

- shift our focus from broader economy-wide developments to the international
  activities of individual firms

Globalization Varies (by firm)

- Nike, Levi's: >50% of sales from international markets
- others clothing firms much lower

Why go international?

- why would iRobot, manufacturer of the robotic Roomba vacuuming and Braava
  mopping systems, want to expand internationally?
- my thoughts:
  - access to new markets
  - access to cheaper raw materials
  - access to cheaper production facilities
- prof highlights
  - access to a larger market
    - OECD countries and emerging markets (e.g., China, India)
  - access better or lower-cost factors
    - labor, natural resources, technology, logistics
  - reduce overall business risk
  - leverage core capabilities
  - develop new capabilities
    - location-specific advantages
    - learning and spillovers

John Deer Exec

- dominated in the US in early 20th century
- then expansion into Canada, Mexico
- after WWII, expansion to Europe
- then the BRICS countries, etc
- following trends of human flourishing
- largest tractor market in the world is India (although they're small tractors
  for the most part)

How to enter foreign markets: Modes of Entry

- exporting
- licensing (franchising)
- strategic alliance
- joint venture
- wholly-owned subsidiary

Market Entry modes

- exporting
  - sale into foreign markets
  - direct exports or export via an agent
- licensing or franchising
  - contract with a local partner
  - transfer intangibles (technology, know-how, IP)
  - monitor performance
- strategic alliance
  - local partner, active coordination
  - broader scope of joint activities (e.g., R&D, marketing)
- international joint venture
  - jointly-owned independent company
  - contributed resources ($ and others)
  - manage jointly, and share in profits
- wholly-owned subsidiary
  - establish a 100% owned unit in a foreign country
  - greenfield: build the unit from scratch
  - brownfield: acquire fixed assets and reuse
  - acquisition: buy a local company and integrate

Gradients

- higher ownership and control this end
  - wholly-owned subsidiary
  - joint venture
  - strategic alliance
  - licensing
  - exporting
- reduced risk & costs (& returns) this end

## Foreign Market Entry Part 2

What's different about international?

- is expanding internationally no different than expanding geographically?
- what additional challenges do you anticipate when a company expands to another
  country relative to (say) another state?

Challenges in Foreign Markets

- regulations
- trade & investment barriers
- different institutions
- different culture (language)
- currency
- animosity, politics, anti-foreign bias

"Liability of Foreignness": More costly to do business abroad

- cultural and socio-economic unfamiliarity
- geographic distance
- institutional voids and legal risks
- economic conditions and risks
- currency differences and ricks
- political biases and instability

How to internationalize

- choose entry mode based on ability to cope with liabilities of foreignness
  - over time, firms learn to overcome these liabilities
- "stages model" of internationalization
  - expand into similar, proximate markets first
  - use lower risk market entry modes
  - over time, learn and expand into more distant markets with higher risk entry
    modes

"Born global" firms

- increasingly, firms are international from birth)
- overcoming foreign entry challenges by using
  - global communications networks (internet)
  - global flows of talent and entrepreneurs
  - local advantages in resources and knowledge
  - government policies to overcome barriers

## National Origins of Competitive Advantage

National Competitive Advantage

- are some countries more competitive than others in certain industries?
- seems strange to ask when competitive advantage is mainly driven by
  intangibles (human capital, technology)
- so raw materials and location should not matter. And seemingly open access to
  intangibles worldwide
- and yet, countries appear to have competitive advantage in certain industries
  - Automobiles - Germany & Japan
  - Computer manufactures - Chain & Taiwan
  - Consumer electronics - Japan & South Korea
  - Mining companies - Australia
  - Movies - USA & India
  - Financial services - United Kingdom

Porter's Diamond Model

- center: National Competitive Advantage
- right: Demand conditions (ie power of buyers)
- top: Competitive Intensity in Focal Industry (ie rivalry)
- left: Factor Conditions (ie power of suppliers)
- bottom: Related & Supporting Industries / Complementers (ie the 6th force -
  complementers)

National Competitive Advantage

- factor conditions: a nation's endowments in terms of national, human and other
  resources, as well as supportive infrastructure and institutions
- demand conditions: specific characteristics (and high expectations) of demand
  in a firm's domestic market
- competitive intensity: highly competitive environments tend to stimulate firms
  to outperform others (e.g German car industry)
- related and supporting industries: leadership in related and supporting
  industries fosters world-class competitors in downstream industry
  complementarity

Applying the framework

- Saudi Arabia - Vision 2030. Focal areas:
  - logistics
  - energy
  - mining
  - industry
- According to Porter's Diamond Model, which of these efforts are most likely to
  succeed?
  - my thoughts
    - energy (factor conditions)
    - maybe mining (related and supporting industries)

Implications for global strategy

- identifying potential sources of competition
- understanding your own competitive advantages relative to foreign competitors
- tapping into foreign country advantages (location decisions)
- co-creating a supportive ecosystem (cluster)

## MNE Strategies

A key tension in MNE strategy

- cost reduction: MNEs can reduce operating costs in international business by
  using scale and deploying common resources across their global operations
  (e.g. Tesla)
- local responsiveness: MNEs can grow market share if they tailor their
  offerings to local customer preferences and host-country requirements (e.g.
  McDonald's)

Four quadrants of strategy for an MNE

- high pressure for cost reductions & local responsiveness:
  - transnational strategy
  - typically a matrix structure for reporting for local managers - both within
    their own country and to a global product center
  - ABB, Bertelsmann, P&G
- high pressure for cost reductions & low pressure for local responsiveness:
  - global-standardization strategy
  - organization around product lines internationally, low independence by
    country. Local managers report to global product centers
  - infosys, lenovo, siemens energy, tesla
- low pressure for cost reductions & high pressure for local responsiveness:
  - localization strategy
  - common for consumer products
  - empower local country operators
  - bridgestone, nestle, philips
- low pressure for cost reductions & local responsiveness:
  - international strategy
  - company largely just sells their original product internationally, operate
    from a single business division
  - harley-davidson, rolex, starbucks

Interview with John Deer exec

- how does Deer do its international strategy
- it's hard, lots of details
- regulatory variance - labor, privacy laws
- but such a prize available
- reporting of international managers
  - at first: each country/factory was very independent
  - now: a very matrixed situation

Four MNE Strategies

- International strategy
  - leveraging home-based core competencies
  - selling the same products or services in both domestic and foreign markets
  - ex: starbucks
  - often the first in internationalizing
  - leverages core competences
  - economies of scale
  - los-cost implementation
  - no or limited local responsiveness
  - highly affected by exchange rate fluctuations
  - IP embedded in product or service could be expropriated
- Localization (product differentiation) strategy
  - maximize local responsiveness via a multi-domestic strategy
  - consumers will perceive them to be domestic companies
  - ex: Nestle
  - highest possible local responsiveness
  - reduced exchange-rate exposure
  - duplication of key business functions in multiple countries
  - little or no economies of scale
  - little or no learning across different regions
  - high risk of IP expropriation
- global (cost leadership) strategy
  - economies of scale and location economies
  - pursing a global division of labor based on best-of-class capabilities
    reside at the lowest cost
  - ex: lenovo R&D in Beijing, Shanghai, Raleigh; production centers in Mexico,
    India and China
  - leverage location economies global division of labor based on wherever
    best-of-class capabilities reside at lowest cost
  - economies of scale
  - no local responsiveness
  - little or no product differentiation
  - some exchange-rate exposure
  - "race to the bottom" as wages increase
  - some risk of IP expropriation
- Transnational strategy
  - combination of localization strategy (responsiveness) with global strategy
    (low-cost position)
  - think of value chain, backward vs forward integration. Backward side can be
    standardized, run for cost leadership. Forward can be differentiated, so the
    products adapt somewhat to the local market
  - ex: German multimedia conglomerate Bertelsmann
  - attempts to combine benefits of localization and standardization strategies
    simultaneously by creating a global matrix structure
  - economies of scale, location , and learning
  - global matrix structure is costly and difficult to implement, leading to
    high failure rate
  - some exchange-rate exposure
  - high risk of IP expropriation

Conclusion

- global strategy is essential in an era of globalization
- foreign market entry mode choices
- stages model of internationalization and born globals
- Porter's Diamond model of national competitive advantage
- four MNE strategic choices in the global marketplace
