## 2-1 Analyzing the Macro-environment

### 2-1.1 The PESTEL Framework

Toyota's external environment

- what are the major elements in Toyota's external environment?
  - competitors, economic growth, mass transit, climate change, electric car
    technology, consumer trends, automobile electronics
- how to do this brainstorming systematically?

Nested layers model of a company (outside in)

- Macro Environment
- Industry environment
- The Firm

PESTEL Framework

- P: Political
  - local, state, national and regional
  - public policy sensitivities
  - stability, security, corruption
- E: Economic
  - grow, employment, inflation
  - interest and exchange rates
  - economic inequality
- S: Socio-cultural
  - demographic trends
  - values and culture
  - aspirations and expectations
- T: Technological
  - trends in R&D and Innovation
  - disruption and new business models
  - process and operational innovation
- E: Ecological
  - pollution, sustainability
  - conservation
  - climate change
- L: Legal
  - courts (multiple jurisdictions)
  - antitrust, labor, liability (tort)
  - international treaties and laws

PESTEL Framework Applied to Toyota

- Political: openness to trade and investment, regional stability,
  transportation and energy policy
- Economic: continued growth, economic stability, exchange and interest rates
- Sociocultural: urbanization and growing middle class, aspiration to western
  lifestyles, green living, desire for convenience = Technological: Electric
  (and hybrid) cars, on-board computing (including self-driving) ride apps (e.g.
  Uber) solar and battery infrastructure
- Ecological: climate change, air pollution , used car waste and recycling
- Legal: trade and investment treaties, liability and labor laws, carbon taxes,
  global warning treaties: (UNFCCC, Paris Agreement)

Using PESTEL Analysis

- can be used to systematically examine important macro environmental trends
- BUT
  - not a comprehensive checklist
  - no guidance on implications for a company or industry
  - no guidance for how to respond

What did we learn

- a firm's environment can be seen as consisting of multiple layers
- PESTEL Framework: Used to analyze outermost macro-environment
  - a good checklist
  - but requires skill and judgement

### Executive Expertise: The External Environment

What elements of the external environment are (or were) critical for your
business? How do you monitor external developments?

- Kurt Bock, insurance:
  - financial regulation all over the place
  - competitors, new entrants
- Sean Chou, Fieldglass - cloud software
  - technology tailwinds
  - changing composition of the workforce
  - compliance for workforce composition
- Al Goldstein, software fintech
  - compliance, legal, regulatory changes since 2008 financial crisis

## 2-2 Industry Analysis - I

### 2-2.1 Structure, Conduct and Performance

Industry Environment

- suppliers and buyers
- substitute products/services
- complementors
- can be defined to be narrow or broad

Industry Analysis

- systematically examines different factors and structural features in an
  industry
- aims to explain and predict industry profitability
- what is an industry?
  - set of similar firms associated with a single product-market
  - nested concept. An industry can be defined narrowly or broadly

Why care about industry analysis?

- understand why an industry is more or less profitable, and whether (when) it
  might change
- decide which product-markets to invest more resources in, and which ones to
  enter or divest from
- intervene with strategic actions to change (increase) the profitability of an
  industry

Industry profitability in long run (in the US)

- varies from 2% to 35% annual return
- median is around 14%
- industry effects explain about 21% of "explained profitability", on average
  (~12% of overall profitability)
- high profitability: Pharmaceutical drugs 20.3% ROE Return on Equity
- low profitability: Airlines 1.1% ROE
- what are the systematic differences between these high & low profitability
  industries?

The Business of Soccer

- Premier Leaugue: way more profitable than the other leagues. Why?
  - global marketing, in english
  - structure of the league
    - centralized TV rights deals: scale and bargaining advantages
    - sharing of TV revenues: balanced teams & competitive soccer
    - "financial fair play" rules: limits competition over players salaries

Structure-Conduct-Performance Paradigm (SCP)

- Industry Structure
  - product differentiation
  - buyers and sellers
  - barriers to entry
  - cost structures
  - demand growth
  - switching costs
- Firm's Conduct (informed by Industry Structure)
  - advertising
  - R&D spending
  - new product development
  - pricing
  - capital investment bargaining
- Performance (informed by Firm's Conduct)
  - economic profits (return in excess of risk-adjusted cost of capital)

Industry Analysis: 5 Forces Framework

- Based on the SCP paradigm
- structure defined by the fire forces
  - threat of new entrants
  - rivalry among industry firms
  - threat of substitutes
  - bargaining power of buyers
  - bargaining power of suppliers
- each force is identified relative to the focal industry
- robust, reliable framework
- industrial organization origins
- typically represented in graphical format
  - center: rivalry
  - left/right: suppliers & buyers
  - above/below: entrants & substitutes

### 2-2.2 Introducing the 5 Forces Framework

Industry Analysis: 5 forces

- forces
  - new entrants
  - substitutes
  - buyers
  - suppliers
  - rivalry
- need to understand structural attributes of each of the "forces" that explain
  profitability

Threat of New Entrants

- natural entry barriers
  - underlying logic: more difficult for new entrants to develop
    cost-competitive production base (supply-side)
    - scale economies
      - costs decline with scale of production
      - ex: oil refining, semiconductors, steel, software
    - scope economies
      - costs decline when multiple products are made
      - ex: car models built on same platform, online retailing
    - learning curve economies
      - costs decline with total cumulative production over time
      - ex: aircraft, disk drives, LCD screens
    - capital requirements
      - ex: new semiconductor plants, new aircraft or car design
      - further compounded by high risk
      - only a barrier when the numbers are very large: billions.
  - underlying logic: more difficult for new entrants to reach customers and
    build demand)
    - product differentiation
      - customers are loyal to existing products & brands
      - intangible product attributes and emotional attachment
    - access to distribution channels
      - shelf space may be limited
      - logistics of distribution may be difficult
  - underlying logic: more difficult for new entrants to reproduce advantages
    that existing firms in the industry already have
    - other advantages: raw material access, favorable location, regulations
      proprietary, technologies and process
- expected retaliation
  - underlying logic: threat of retaliation makes it less attractive for new
    firms to enter an industry
    - strong firm(s), reputation, slow growth
    - also called "strategic" entry barriers
    - existing firms respond with aggressive pricing, new products, etc
    - reputation for retaliation, slow industry growth and high exit costs make
      retaliation more likely
    - stronger firms with resources and excess capacity are better able to
      retaliate

Rivalry among industry firms

- intensity is higher when
  - underlying logic: when can firms resist the temptation to lower prices in
    order to get more revenue or market share?
    - industry concentration is low
      - extent to which product/sale is the hands of a small number of firms
      - 4-firm concentration ratio: Market share of the top-4 firms combined
      - Hirschman Herfindahl Index (HHI): Sum of squared market shares
        - 0-1 (0 being perfectly competitive, 1 with a single monopolist)
    - product differentiation is low
      - heterogeneous preferences among consumers for different products
      - ex: brand loyalty, segmented needs
      - arguably the single most important structural attribute of an industry
  - fixed/storage costs are high
    - decreases incentives to sell more by dropping price
    - ex: semiconductors, airline seats, telecom bandwidth
  - demand growth is slow
    - growing demand allows firms to grow sales without eating into each other's
      market share
  - over-capacity is high
    - decreases incentives to increase sales
  - exit barriers are high
    - firms exit the industry rather than stay and fight for market share at a
      loss
- destructive price competition
  - when competition is based on price, it is easily matched by rivals and
    lowers profits for all firms

Substitutes

- logic of substitutes
  - substitute products limit potential profits by constraining prices that an
    industry can charge, especially if
    - meet similar needs
    - better cost structure
    - more innovative or value-providing
    - improving quickly in cost/performance

Buyers

- buyers are a bigger threat when
  - buyers are concentrated: few buyers buy a large % of sales
  - product is a large % of costs/income for buyer
  - product is not important for buyer quality
  - few switching costs for the buyer
  - buyers can backward integrate
- underlying logic: the more the buyer relies on the industry, and not vice
  versa, the greater the industry's bargaining power

Suppliers

- suppliers are a bigger threat when
  - suppliers are concentrated: few suppliers control most supply
  - suppliers face few substitute products
  - suppliers can forward-integrate
  - the suppliers' products are important for the focal industry
  - suppliers' products are differentiated or present high switching costs
- underlying logic: the more the supplier relies on selling to the industry, and
  not vice versa, the lower its bargaining power

### 2-2.3 Applying the 5 Forces Framework

How does application of the 5 Forces Framework help explain the low and high
profitability of airlines and pharmaceuticals?

Airlines - why so unprofitable?

- rivalry: (key) perishable, high fixed cost, undifferentiated service
- entry: (key) easy to lease plane and crew, buy/lease gates and landing slots
- suppliers: (minor) fuel and labor suppliers have some bargaining power
- buyers, substitutes: (very minor) matter to a lesser extent

Pharmaceuticals - why so profitable?

- entry barriers: R&D investment, patents, marketing and regulatory
  capabilities/access
- rivalry: differentiated product, patent protected, brand loyalty
- buyers: vital health need, fragmented decision-making, insurance coverage
- substitutes: generics were less competitive until recent years
- suppliers: mostly commodities

What did we learn?

- a firms' industry is the most proximate part of its environment.
  - explains 12-13% of profitability
- structure-conduct-performance is a key foundation for industry analysis
- 5-Forces Framework
  - forces defined relative to focal industry
  - central idea: structural attributes of forces drive competition over
    industry profits

## 2-3 Industry Analysis - II

### 2-3.1 Dynamic Industry Analysis

How to use the 5-Forces Framework

- clearly identify the industry, and "who" the 5 forces are
- examine the structural attributes of each force
- develop an assessment of the "strength" of each force
  - ex: strong, moderate, weak
- combine analysis of all 5 forces for overall assessment of profitability
- examine dynamics, changes in structural attributes over time

Combining analysis of all 5 forces

- How to combine the 5 forces: simply average the impacts? (NO)
- Example, two industries with same average force strength
  - industry 1: all 5 forces are moderate
  - industry 2: some forces very weak, others very strong
  - which industry better to be in? Industry 1!
- profits are like water in a lake held up by 5 dams, the 5 forces being the
  dams
- pivotal force: the weakest force (the one that lets the most profits out)

Pivotal Force Example

- what is a pivotal force?
  - force that presents the greatest threat from competition/bargaining
  - increasing / mitigating this threat has direct impact on profitability
  - ex: airline consolidation, yield management
- monitor pivotal force(s) and underlying structural attributes
- strategically intervene to reshape the industry

Complements: a sixth force?

- in many industries, complements play a vital role in the success of a product
  or service
  - ex: hardware/software, iOS/Apps, Consoles/Games, cars/gasoline
- complements as the conceptual opposite of substitutes
  - industry profits increase with low-cost, high-quality complements
- potential for "coopetition"
  - consider both benefits from, and bargaining with, complementors

Dynamic Industry Analysis

- as industries evolve, structural attributes of forces may change
  - insights from PESTEL analysis of macro-environment
    - ex: maturing pharma industry faces greater threat from generic
      substitutes, fewer new products
  - changes over the product life cycle

10 common errors in 5-forces analysis

- not being clear about industry definition
- using too broad or narrow an industry definition
- not keeping track of actors in each force
- simply describing the actors in each force, ignoring structural attributes
- focusing just on hard attributes (scale/capital) and not enough of behavioral
  ones (risk, brand loyalty)
- using one force to explain another
- stopping with the 5 fores, and not evaluating overall profitability
- assessing profitability as an average of the 5 forces
- confusing short-run industry profits with long-run profitability
- not examining dynamics or implications for managerial action

Industry Analysis Limitations

- mostly static framework
  - can be extended to dynamics
- built on a foundation of competition over value/surplus
  - doesn't provide much insight into value creation and innovation
- requires some sophistication to use
- but advances beyond opportunities and threats (SWOT) and even PESTEL
