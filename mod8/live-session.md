## Global Strategies: Reactions-Interaction

Polls

- what entry mode? wholly-owned subsidiaries
- what MNE strategy? big mix!

Breakout activity

- of the companies your group members used for their reaction, discuss one
  company's global strategies in terms of
  - motivation for expanding internationally
  - choice of foreign market entry mode
  - overall global (MNE) strategy
- class answers
  - GuardForce AI, China
    - moving into China by acquisition, purchased some ~20 local companies
    - zero-touch cleaning robots, specific hotels
    - needed local presence both for distribution and also adapting to local
      market
    - prof: the acquisitions may be of companies that were doing local
      adaptations of robots, so now after the acquisition it's basically just
      meaning the acquiree will be the only supplier
  - CoCa Cola in WWII
    - made a pledge to deliver a soda to each soldier in the front lines for 5
      cents a soda
    - US Serviceman became a brand ambassador of CoCa Cola
    - forced them to build out an international strategy to do achieve that
    - sells "happiness" - so in each local market the drink choices are adapted
      to match that
    - wholly own the manufacturing, and then locally adapt the product
    - India and entrance of Coca Cola, pushed out in the 1970's, back in the
      90's via acquisition of a local company
  - Domino's in India
    - used a licensing with local franchisees
    - localization of flavors, toppings etc by region
    - now India style pizzas (like curry pizza) showing up in US
    - formed a master franchise agreement with Jubilant FoodWorks effectively a
      joint venture
    - Jubilant in turn franchises to local individual outlets
    - food and beverage products in general require lot of localization
    - localize the technology too? Smartphone apps... need to be dumb phone apps
      to achieve penetration in India? No, cheap smartphones everywhere.
    - India: credit card penetration is low, but payment apps very common -
      google pay etc

## Stakeholders and Corporate Governance

Dilemmas with shareholder primacy

- the joint-stock company (i.e., the public company) is one of the most
  consequential innovations in human history
- modern capitalist institutions have addressed many of the major challenges
  with public companies; but also created new dilemmas:
  - over-emphasis on shareholders and return on equity
  - over-emphasis on measurable short-run financial metrics

Breakout

- identify (dilemma: situation where logical behavior is sub-optimal)
  - 1-2 examples of company-level dilemmas
  - 1-2 examples of societal dilemmas
- created by "shareholder primacy"
- as a manager/leader, what do you see as potential solutions toward mitigating
  these dilemmas?
- student responses
  - companies
    - companies pulling out (or not) from Russia
    - Nike: poor labor practices in south-east asia in the 80's/90's
    - impacts on employees after an acquisition
    - Enron - accounting gone crazy
  - societal
    - Erin Bronkivick - water pollution
    - opioid crisis
    - pricing of pharmaceuticals
    - fake it till you make it
    - tobacco companies in the 80's
    - CO2 and many industries today
    - plastic pollution, in our food, in our environment
- prof
  - issues often start with a "good faith lie"
    - show a bit more profits in this quarter than there really are
    - represent a product in a way that isn't really true
  - expectation is often that the lie is temporary
  - but end up in a situation where the lie must get bigger and bigger

The Opioid Epidemic

- exponential growth in opiod deaths
- 100k/yr in 2022
- primary cause: doctor prescribing opioid drug to help manage pain
- opioids were marketed and sold as non-addictive, but the pharmaceutical
  companies had information behind the scenes that shows they were addictive
- Annual economic cost: 95B/150B/600B ?
- human cost: over 70k deaths a year (caused male life span to drop in US, first
  time since WWII). Impact on families (financial, psychological, ...)
- Indictment and bankruptcy of Purdue Pharma
  - Maker of OxyContin
  - Also many others

An addiction economy?

- fast foods, processed food, sugar (salt & fat)
- increase the "cravability" of your product (ie the addictiveness)
- products that take away/reduce people's free will
- digital addiction, gambling addiction

Media and Addiction

- media is not "just a business"
  - news / opinion: truth & integrity critical to society
- grabbing attention is part of the business model
  - "if it bleeds, it leads"
- fear and anger are addictive -> differentiation
  - can build a competitive advantage by hooking people on a brand of fear and
    anger
  - "Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger, Anger leads to
    hate. Hate leads to suffering."
- social media has made it much worse
  - algorithm-driven attention-addiction strategy
  - even the truth seems to have died

What can we do as managers or leaders to address these challenges?

- challenging for public policy, especially when information is central (and can
  be manipulated)

On Homo sapiens - what has made us the stand-out animal?

- human progress is the result of creating, strengthening and bequeathing better
  institutions to future generations
- free market capitalism has been the biggest force in history for improving
  human lives ("large scale flexible cooperation")
- but individual self-interest is the intellectual bedrock of free market
  capitalism (and therein lies a paradox)

A responsibility

- it's not just all about self-interest, even if markets do work mostly in that
  way
- as managers and leaders, we have a professional responsibility to be good
  custodians of our institutions
- I'm not naive about what you or I can do; but together we can lean in the
  right direction - and it can be powerful
- some things are inherently worthy: "we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we
  cannot hallow this ground ... who struggled here have hallowed it far above
  our poor power to add or detract"
- sometimes we need to act in the larger interest because it's the right thing
  to do
- karma from Hindu philosophy: the right action, acting for the right reasons

Gandhi's seven social sins

- wealth without work
- pleasure without conscience
- knowledge without character
- commerce without morality <-- business leaders
- science without humanity
- religion without sacrifice
- politics without principle

Being a leader...

- ... is about work, conscience, character, morality, humanity, sacrifice
  (service) and principle

Takeaways

- larger social responsibility
- CSR: Corporate Social Responsibility
