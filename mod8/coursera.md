## Public Firms and Their Role in Society

Agenda

- introduction
- the public firm
- corporate social responsibility
- mechanisms of governance
- recent developments

Stakeholders and the enterprise

- external stakeholders: customers, suppliers, governments, unions, communities,
  general public
- internal stakeholders: managers, shareholders, bondholders, employees, board
  members

An age of shareholder primacy

- over the last few decades, much higher focus on the obligations of companies
  to shareholders
- in part, reflects a real dilemma in public corporations
- driven by a neo-liberal intellectual worldview
- reinforced by the reality of modern financial markets

Strategic management and the role of business in society

- the public stock company is the backbone of our economy
- four characteristics of public firms:
  - limited liability of investors
  - transferability of investor interest
  - legal personality
  - separation of ownership and control

The public stock company: hierarchy of authority

- stockholder view of management:
  - state charter (Delaware has best defined rules of any US state)
  - shareholders (vote for board of directors)
  - board of directors (appoints management)
  - management (hires/fires employees)
  - employees
- stakeholder view of management:
  - state charter
  - board of directors (responsible for all stakeholders, including
    shareholders)
  - shareholders
  - management
  - employees

Strategic Management and the role of business in society

- 21st century already has two financial crises
  - accounting scandals: Eron, WorldCom, Tyco
  - global financial crisis: real estate bubble burst
- lessons
  - managerial actions affect economy
  - ethical business produces wealth, but unethical practices destroy it
  - stakeholder management is needed

Stakeholder impact analysis questions

- who are our stakeholders?
- what are our stakeholders' interests and claims?
- what opportunities and threats do our stakeholders present?
- what economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic responsibilities do we have
  to our stakeholders?
- what should we do to effectively address the stakeholder concerns?

## Corporate Social Responsibility

Pyramid of corporate social responsibility (top to bottom)

- philanthropic responsibilities: corporate citizenship
- ethical responsibilities: do what is right, just and fair
- legal responsibilities: laws and regulations are society's codified ethics,
  define minimum acceptable standard
- economic responsibilities: Gain and sustain competitive advantage

Question for discussion

- "the only social responsibility of business is to increase profits so long as
  it stays within the rules of the game" - Milton Friedman, 1962
- are philanthropic responsibilities part of the public corporation's
  responsibilities, or is its only social responsibility to increase profits?
- prof's answer
  - today's businesses tend to do much more than just make profits
  - but does Corporate Social Responsibility help build competitive advantage?
  - answer might depend on where you do business...
    - a survey across countries
      - UAE, Japan, India - less interested in CSR
      - China, Brazil, Germany - more interested in CSR
      - max: UAE 85% view business as just profits
      - min: Spain 35% view business as more than just profits

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

- shared value-creation framework
  - expand customer base and bring in non-consumers
  - expand internal firm value chains by including more non-traditional partners
    such as NGOs
  - focus on creating new regional clusters
- GE recognizes a convergence between shareholders and stakeholders
- empirical evidence supports the idea that "firms can do well ($) by doing good
  (CSR)"

Corporate Governance

- corporate governance represents the relationship among stakeholders that is
  used to determine and control the strategic direction and performance of
  organizations
- agency costs are the sum of incentive costs, monitoring costs, enforcement
  costs, and individual financial losses incurred by principals because it is
  impossible to use governance mechanisms to guarantee total compliance by the
  agent
- corporate governance
  - mechanisms to direct and control a firm
  - ensure the pursuit of strategic goal
  - address the principal-agent problem
- when corporate governance fails
  - accounting scandal
  - global financial crisis
  - bernard madoff -> ponzi scheme
- information asymmetry
  - insider information - ImClone and Galleon Group
- agency theory
  - views a firm as a nexus of legal contracts
    - relationships among shareholders, managers and hierarchies
    - firms need to design work tasks
- adverse selection
  - misrepresentation of employees abilities or knowledge to do a job
- moral hazard
  - difficulty to ascertain whether the agent gives his/her best to do the job

## Mechanisms of Corporate Governance

Agency Problem

- Berle and Means in the "The Modern Corporation" inquired whether we have "any
  justification for assuming that those in control of a modern corporation will
  also choose to operate it in the interest of the stockholders" ? (in 1932)
- what are the "institutions of capitalism" that lessen the problem of
  separation of (shareholder) ownership (the risk-bearing principals) from
  control (managerial decision-making agents)?
  - takeovers (the market for corporate control)
  - recruitment of executives from outside the firm
  - monitoring by boards of directors
  - compensation heavily weighted toward stock options
  - monitoring by institutional investors
  - debt (minimize free cash flow; e.g. LBOs)
    - depends your industry.
    - low-margin industries, you want to minimize free cash to minimize the
      agency problem
    - but if you're in a high-margin industry, and you have huge R&D costs -
      then agency costs are small compared to the cost of staying up on new
      technology
  - separate Chairperson and CEO
  - internal control of multidivisional -- "miniature capital market", divisions
    effectively compete against each other for the finances that corporate
    controls

Board of Directors

- the centerpiece of corporate governance
- inside and outside directors
- functions:
  - general strategic oversight and guidance
  - selecting, evaluating and compensating the CEO
  - overseeing CEO succession plan (recently problematic at both HP and Apple)
  - providing guidance on executives and their compensation
  - reviewing, monitoring, and approving strategic initiatives
  - conducting a risk assessment and mitigation
  - ensuring a firm's audited financial statements
  - ensuring a firm's compliance with laws and regulations

Question for discussion

- in 2011 there were 18 members of the board of directors for GE, with a market
  capitalization of about 325B.
- 15 where independent outside directors
- one of the inside directors was CEO
- in roughly 2/3 of US public firms, the CEO of the company also serves as Chair
  of the Board of Directors
- what arguments can be made for and against splitting the roles of CEO and
  Chair of the Board of Directors?
- my answer
  - alignment can help efficiency, cohesion
  - but leaves the company more vulnerable to problems stemming from that one
    individual

Corporate governance around the world

- difference in national institutions and culture
  - "free" market economies
    - state-directed capitalism (less freedom) e.g. China
    - free market capitalism (more freedom) e.g. US
- Germany
  - stakeholder capitalism (labor representation on BoD)
- France
  - stakeholder capitalism (state-owned enterprises)
- China
  - state-owned enterprises (state is involved in firm's strategic plans)

## Recent Developments

Two central challenges

- over-emphasis on shareholders and return on equity
- over-emphasis on measurable short-term financial metrics

Broadening the mission

- corporate social responsibility
- sustainability goals
- balanced scorecard
  - financial: EVA, profitability, growth
  - customer: differentiation, cost, quick response
  - operations: products developed, order fulfillment, demand management
  - organizational: leadership, learning, ability to change

Ecosystem strategies

- James Moore, HBR 1993
- Business ecosystem: an economic community supported by a foundation of
  interacting organizations and individuals - the organisms of the business
  world
- examples: malls, Toyota supplier-dealer network, Apple, Amazon, Facebook,
  Silicon Valley, Coursera
- particularity salient for many modern platform-based businesses
- "ecosystem" as a term in business news: exponential growth

Protection _from_ shareholders

- old approaches: poison pills, etc
- going / staying private
  - private equity
  - unicorns
- dual class shares
  - publicly-traded version has fewer voting rights, while the founders hold a
    class that has more voting rights
  - cautionary tale: the parable of WeWork
    - softbank had pay over 1B to buy out the founder's shares in order to get
      him out of there
