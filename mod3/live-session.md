# Live Session Mod 3

Today

- focus: Internal Analysis
- Review of Industry Analysis from last week
- tour of campus

## Industry Analysis

- breakout session to discuss
- focus on one industry
  - high/low/medium in profitability?
  - which of the five forces are most relevant?
  - which one is the pivotal force?
  - identify 1-2 key structural attributes that underlie your 5-forces analysis

Prof highlights

- defining your industry well is key to any good industry analysis
  - be specific
  - affects how environment forces will be categorized
- pivotal force
- breaking up substitutes and rivalry
  - rivalry follows directly from industry definition
  - substitutes are alternatives to your industry definition
- structural features of industry
  - ex: technological complexity (or lack thereof) of the activities in the
    industry
- short run vs long run profitability
  - online banking industry long run profitability dominated by rivalry
- making a sticky relationship with your customer

## Internal Analysis & Competitive Advantage

Competitive Advantage

- literally better performance (EVA) than competitors
- better performance is linked to internal firm attributes
- e.g. what gives a pizzeria a competitive advantage

Pizzeria: Competitive Advantage (three levels of analysis)

- value chain (or network) of activities: choice, order and coordination of
  tasks performed
- resources: location, special oven, recipe, chef, manager/staff, reputation
- capabilities: (what do they do better than others) culinary, sourcing,
  production, marketing and delivery capabilities

V-R-I Framework

- Properties of a resource or capability -> implications
- Valuable?
  - no: you have nothing.
  - yes: rare?
    - no: competitive parity
    - yes: inimitable?
      - no: temporary competitive advantage
      - yes: sustained competitive advantage
- resource by resource (or c by c) analysis

Sustaining Competitive Advantage

- three "threats": Imitation, durability, relevance
  - competitive view: imitation, replication, substitution
  - capability lifecycle: durability of the advantage
  - schumpeterian view: relevance of the advantage
    - Joseph Schumpeter

Competitive Advantage Exercise - breakout group

- create an advertising firm with a competitive advantage
- focus on 2 key resources or capabilities for your firm
- threats of imitation / substitution of these advantages? reduce the threats?
- durability and relevance of these advantages? solutions?
- my answer:
  - creative thinking (capability)
    - if done really well, hard to imitate especially at scale
    - could be substitute possibly via outsourcing
    - likely to be relevant for long time
    - may not be durable - vulnerable to key people leaving the company, a
      change in company culture, etc
  - network of contacts, clients built up over time (resource)
    - can be imitated by others, but requires lots of time & investment
    - perhaps possible to substituted by paying for contacts somehow?
    - pretty durable
    - relevance challenged by evolving modern technology
- prof: two key resources, both intangible
  - human capital, creative people
    - value: creates advertising that appeals to consumers
    - rarity: open question. relative, unique style
    - threat from imitation/substitution:
      - competitor copies your style
      - competitor poaches key creative people
      - competitor hires from same school, same background as your people
      - hard to imitate: creative built into company culture
    - threat from durability/relevance?
      - your creative culture may degrade/evolve
      - will AI make your human creativity irrelevant?
  - relationships with clients
    - threat from imitation/substitution:
      - competitor poaches key account managers
- biggest threat to your firm's competitive advantage?
  - imitation / substitution
  - durability <--- my choice
  - relevance
