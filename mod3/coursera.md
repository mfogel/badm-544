## Module 3 Overview Lecture

Strategic Fit & Internal Analysis

- strategic fit: strategy must align the firm with its environment
- internal analysis: a critical step for developing a strategy, especially one
  that creates a competitive advantage

Key topics

- competitive advantage
  - firm effects in performance
- sources of competitive advantage
  - activities, resources, capabilities
  - value chains, value networks (representations of activities)
- sustained competitive advantage
  - inimitability and immobility
  - durability and relevance

## 3-1 Competitive Advantage & Firm Performance

### 3-1.1 Competitive Advantage & Firm Performance

What drives company performance

- industry effects: performance resulting from being in a more/less profitable
  industry
- company effects: performance resulting from unique attributes of the company
- which is more important?
  - firm effects account for the majority of explainable firm performance
  - in total, about 50% of company performance can be explained by these two
    effects

Examples of high performance firms

- Southwest Airlines
- fedex
- amazon
- apple
- etc

From the soccer field

- top soccer club in the world?
- not in playing soccer, but financially
- Premier league by far the most successful league financially
- Forbes soccer valuations
  - #1 Real Madrid (Spain La Liga)
  - #2 Barcelona (Spain La Liga)
  - most of the rest are from the premier league

Competitive advantage

- firms that perform better than their competition are said to have a
  competitive advantage
- how to define competition?
  - some set of rivals in the same industry
  - industry average competitor
- how to define "better performance"?
  - long run profit performance
  - economic value added?

What is "better" performance?

- A/C Profitability: ROA (return on assets), ROE, ROCE etc
  - but these are backward-looking, tell you about the past
- Market value: stock price x number of shares
  - but doesn't include internal info
- Long run profitability (NPV)
  - but is imprecise
- Economic Value Added (EVA)
  - price of product/service minus cost or product/service
  - challenge: difficult to measure in practice
- best approach:
  - use multiple of these measures
  - but in this class from here forward we will use EVA

Sustained Competitive Advantage

- where a firm's performance advantage, relative to its competition, is
  sustained over time
- two key questions
  - heterogeneity: where do the inter-firm differences in performance come from?
  - sustaining: how do performance advantages enjoyed by a firm become durable?

What did we learn

- inter-firm differences (company effects) are a major contributor to
  performance
  - important to understand sources of firm competitive advantage
- what do we mean by competitive advantage?
  - and sustained competitive advantage?
  - and how can we measure it?

## 3-2 Sources of Competitive Advantage

### 3-2.1 Activities of the Firm

Why do some firms perform better?

- ex: Apple: many reasons can be argued why it is better

Sources of competitive advantage

- Three main conceptual views
  - activities (sets of) (developed primarily by Micheal Porter)
    - activities the firm chooses and does not choose to undertake
    - how those activities are done
    - how those activities are linked together
    - 100's or 1000's of these
  - resources
    - one firm owns something, other firms don't
    - 10's of these
  - capabilities
    - ex: great customer service, low inventory cost management
    - less than 10 of these

Why do some soccer teams perform better (in the game) than others?

- activities: dribble well, pass the ball well, get free well, aren't selfish
  with the ball
- resources: star players, top managers, fan base, reputation.
- capabilities: ticy-taca style of play, fast counter attacks strategy,
  management that outperforms

Analyzing activities

- two challenges
  - how to organize a large set of activities into meaningful subsets?
  - how to illustrate the relationships between these subsets of activities?
- two solutions
  - value chain
  - value network

Value Chain

- applies well to a manufacturing companies
  - example primary activities (directly along the linear value chain)
    - supplier logistics
    - intermediate production
    - final production
    - distribution logistics
    - marketing & sales
    - customer service
  - support activities (everything else)
    - Procurement
    - HR
    - accounting & finance
    - information systems
    - R&D
- doesn't work well for service industries
  - airlines, telephone services, financial services, healthcare, consulting
- applies pretty generally to most manufacturing industries, companies

Value Network

- applies well to an airline. Activities:
  - purchasing and leasing planes
  - crew
  - baggage handlers
  - marketing, sales
  - plan route structure
  - get gates, permissions
  - purchasing fuel
  - managing labor relations
- activities are not arranged in a linear chain
- specific to each industry, and really to each company

### 3-2.2 Resources and Capabilities

Types of resources: an inventory

- tangible resources
  - financial: cash, borrowing capacity
  - physical: buildings, machinery
- intangible resources
  - technology: innovations, know how, creative products
  - relational: reputations, distributors, suppliers
  - human capital: skill & expertise, team cohesion, leadership

Which resources matter most?

- which can most improve EVA?
  - increase the price-cost wedge?
  - is access to the resource "rare"?
- in general, a bigger role for _intangibles_
  - research shows that tangible assets explain a much smaller fraction of firm
    value today

What are capabilities?

- the capacity to perform a particular activity in a reliable and at least
  minimally satisfactory manner
  - entails deploying, combining and linking resources
    - example: apple & marketing
  - results from learning, encoded in organizational routines
    - example: apple known to make easy-to-use and customer-friendly products
  - need not map to a functional area
    - example: apple's innovative products don't map to functions

Source of competitive advantage?

- activity sets, resources or capabilities can create a competitive advantage
  if:
  - value criterion: helps increase EVA
  - rarity criterion: the ability to increase EVA is not commonly available to
    other firms

Common roots of heterogeneity

- firms possess different activity sets, resources & capabilities due to
  - history
    - example: apple influence of founders
  - path dependence
    - example: apple decisions management went along the way. Ex: opened the
      itunes store to 3rd-party apps
  - managerial foresight
  - luck
    - luck vs foresight - hard to know which is there

Which conceptual lens to use?

- activities: fine grained analysis
- capabilities:
  - coarse grained, substantive differentiators
  - analysis is easier
  - easier to link with the environment, and to EVA
- resources: between the extremes
- ultimately, a matter of judgement.
  - in-depth analysis? activities
  - quick summary? capabilities?
  - in practice: probably want to use a blended approach

What did we learn?

- three conceptual lenses for analyzing inter-firm differences in perofmrance
  - activities (sets of)
  - resources
  - capabilities
- link to competitive parity and competitive advantage
  - value
  - rarity

## 3-3 Sustained Competitive Advantage

## 3-3.1 Sustained Competitive Advantage

Sustaining competitive advantage

- a key goal for strategic management
- four potential challenges
  - threats to rarity
    - imitation: implement your processes and routines
    - replication: use different processes, but achieve similar results
  - threats to value creation
    - (non) durability: ex - brand or teamwork degrades over time
    - (non) relevance: ex - market no longer values your product

Barriers to imitation & replication

- "isolating mechanisms"
- examples
  - casual ambiguity: unclear exactly where a company's success comes from
  - complexity: combining successful activities in the right way
  - tacit knowledge: the unspoken, assumed cultural knowledge at a company
  - resource mobility barriers: prevent key employees from being lured away by a
    competitor
  - property rights: mining lease, patents, trademarks

Imitation of value chains / networks

- a built-in barrier to imitation
- difficult for rivals to know what a firm's activities are, and how they are
  all combined

V-R-I Framework

- Resource-based view
- are resources (or capabilities) Valuable, Rare and Inimitable?
  - Valuable, but not rare or inimitable? Competitive parity
  - Valuable and rare, but not inimitable? Temporary competitive advantage
  - Valuable, rare and inimitable: Sustained competitive advantage
- says very little about durability and relevance
  - most literature is usually focused on avoiding/preventing intimation &
    replication

Durability and Relevance

- often the day-to-day focus of strategic managers
- durability
  - "leaky bucket", so can either
    - plug the leaks (ex: prevent talent from leaving)
    - or continuously top-up the bucket (ex: hire new talent)
- relevance
  - arguably biggest challenge
  - core competencies become core rigidities
  - requires dynamic capabilities

Module Conclusions

- firm effects in performance
  - competitive advantage
- sources of competitive advantage
  - activities
  - resources
  - capabilities
- can judge these sources of competitive advantge by their
  - value (EVA)
  - rarity
- sustaining competitive advantage
  - barriers to imitation and replication
  - durability and relevance

### Executive Expertise: Competitive Advantage

What are some key sources of competitive advantage for your business? How do you
ensure that your business sustains its competitive advantage?

- Al Goldstein
  - difficult to accomplish, especially the sustainable part
  - avant - grown to scale, technological advantages, deployment of academic
    papers, brand, operational excellence
  - have to be willing to continuously challenge assumptions, cannibalize your
    own business units
- Sean Chou
  - never drank their own cool-aid, always felt their product wasn't good enough
  - always chasing the customer's desires
  - figured out channel relationships well
    - understand the roles they play vs those of the channel
    - became huge competitive advantage
  - long-run, competitive advantage has to come from the people
    - culture of never being satisfied with the status quo
- Kurt Bock
  - the channel, the financial reps, are a strong competitive advantage
  - updating systems to the modern era
    - from mainframe, cobalt-based systems to
    - modern, browser-based flexible applications
