- Corporate scope:
  - what businesses should you be in?
  - vertical, horizontal, geographic scope

## Generic Strategies & Strategic Renewal: Discussion

- discuss your mini-discussions from last week's assignments
- trader joes
  - dual strategy? (I would just call them cost leader)
    - cost leader for healthy foods, seasonality for products
    - differentiation by applying their brand to white labeled foods
  - prof:
    - yes, dual strategy, using a frontend/backend disconnect
    - everything in the store (frontend) is done as differentiator
    - everything in the supply chain (backend) is done as cost leadership
- christian loievuton shoes
  - very much a differentiator
  - very niche clientele
  - 500 - 25k for a pair of shoes
  - shoes have a red heel
- prof
  - cost leadership: small margins, lots of sales
  - differentiation: large margins, few sales
- southwest airline
  - cost leader
  - but has some differentiation! Free bags. Direct flights.
  - prof thoughts:
    - started out as a pure cost leader
    - but airline industry changed over time - added fees
    - added some differentiation in specific spots
    - cost advantage: the simplicity of its operations. One type of airline.
      Quick turnaround. HR strategies.
    - differentiation: customer-focused services. Ex: free bags.
- tesla (prof)
  - differentiation - the style, iconic. Beyond just electric.
  - car industry evolution
    - the assembly line with humans
    - evolved to the assembly line with robots
    - but what if you step back and redesign the whole thing with robots?
  - factory design, manufacturing process hoping to delivery cost advantage
  - selling direct to customer, eliminating the whole dealership system

## Corporate Strategy & Corporate Scope

Corporate Scope

- shift from business strategy to corporate strategy
- three dimensions: vertical, horizontal, geographic
  - today: vertical & horizontal

Lead in... Vertical Integration

- De-link two issues (Oliver Williamson: Markets & Hierarchies, Noble Prize)
  - what is the objective? What market power, resources, efficiencies, etc are
    being sought?
  - what organizational form (outsourcing or vertical integration or an alliance
    or something creative) best achieves the objective?

"All forms of organization are flawed"

- administrative costs (integration within the firm)
  - weak incentives
  - principal-agent problem
    - division head's motivations may not align with CEO's
  - lack of dynamism
- transaction costs (outsourcing)
  - adverse selection
    - not give you their best talent, their best technology, capabilities
  - moral hazard
    - maximize to letter of the contract, not to other party's best interests,
      motivated to not maintain the same ethical standards (labor,
      environmental, etc)
  - hold up problem
    - outside environment changes after contract signed, but when you need to
      adapt the contract/relationship to reflect that, switching cost is high so
      the same competition isn't there

Motivations for...

- outsourcing
  - targeted incentives
  - to access resources and capabilities
  - ability to aggregate demand (scale)
  - responsive to market and technology trends
- vertical integration
  - market power (foreclosure)
  - controlling quality, cost
  - planning, coordination, control
  - investments in specialized assets

Vertical Integration: Team Exercise

- increasing "vertical" integration of game console makers
- MS (xbox) acquired Activision/Blizzard $68.7B
- Sony (playstation): a whole bunch as well
- Debate in team:
  - Is increasing vertical integration into gaming good for MS?
  - what are the likely motivations for this vertical integration?
  - Comparative / organizational analysis: why is VI better/worse than
    alliances?
- my take
  - control over key games themselves is necessary in order to provide a
    competitive end-to-end gaming experience
  - it's just like mac & their OS... to be a good hardware company you must also
    be a software company
  - so yeah, it's unfortunately needed
- other groups
  - bringing in customer base
  - technology base, shared tech
  - pulling in market share
  - lots of games are free to start, and then you pay for add-ons
- prof emphasis
  - MS already gets a cut of each game that's sold that runs on the console
  - MS already knows all the customers of those games, since they bought an xbox
  - MS already profits from activision/blizzard innovation
  - But bringing them into the same company allows a pairing and alignment of
    tech that otherwise would require a lot of specialized work on each side,
    which each side will be hesitant to do
  - opportunity cost for MS isn't really $$. It's mind space, focus, time of top
    management.
  - could contracts of early access to APIs etc get what we want in terms of
    game integration without integrating?
  - concerns from prof:
    - loss of dynamism. Activision/Blizzard is on top of the world now, but
      unlikely to stay there. MS can't change their flagship game manufacturer
      anymore.
    - possible isolation of other gaming manufacturers
  - pros from prof:
    - coordination argument: alignment of HW & SW, payments, etc
  - prof wouldn't be surprised if 10 years from now Activision/Blizzard is in
    part of fully spun off out of MS

Final thoughts / questions from prof

- When we look at diversification, the same kind of analysis in required.
- Should we integrate our SBUs like in a market, or more tightly than that

Takeaways

- vertical integration pros/cons
