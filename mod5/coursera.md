## Lesson 1

### Introduction: Corporate Scope

Corporate Strategy

- the pursuit of competitive advantage through the configuration and
  coordination of a company's multi-business activities
- involves decisions and actions about
  - the scope of the firm
  - coordinating synergies across businesses
  - corporate transactions

What is Corporate Scope?

- the "footprint" of the company
- what activities or businesses is a company engaged in, and how should they be
  managed?
- dimensions of corporate scope
  - vertical integration (stages of industry value chain / network)
  - geographic scope (regional, national, global markets)
  - horizontal integration (range of products and services)

Examples

- vertical scope growth: PepsiCo acquired its bottlers in 2009 (forward
  integration)
- horizontal scope narrowing: GE was very horizontally spread in 2001, by 2019
  it was more focused on core activities (left media biz, plastics, drastically
  shrunk financials)

### Vertical Scope Part 1

Vertical Scope & Vertical Integration

- which parts of the value chain (or network) should the company operate in?
  - companies can pivot and change where over time
  - similar choice can be applied in horizontal scope as well
- should the same company be integrated across specific stages of the value
  chain (or network)?

Vertical Integration Terminology

- Vertical and horizontal integration
  - horizontal: different products, services
  - vertical integration:
    - usually along the value chain forward or backward
    - but can apply to anything in the value network, if that's a better model
      for your business
- Forward and backward integration
  - applies to integrations along a value chain
  - forward: getting closer to the customer
  - backward: getting closer to the raw materials

Vertical Integration? An Example

- the university of illinois contracts with coursera to host its online courses
  (MOOCs) instead of using its own platform
- is this a good idea?
- what are the pros and cons of outsourcing such a critical function in online
  education?

Motivations for outsourcing

- resources and capabilities (or lack thereof)
- ability to aggregate demand (and thus build scale)
- responsive to market and technology trends (smaller orgs can pivot faster)

Motivations for vertical integration

- market power
  - entry barriers
  - downstream or upstream price maintenance
  - (often market power arguments have serious flaws when applied to corporate
    scope decisions)
- improving quality, cost
- planning, coordinating, control
- investments in specialized assets (buyer needs very specific product/service
  from seller, creates a "hold out problem", which may not be possible to
  resolve without vertical integration)

### Vertical Scope Part 2

Transaction Cost Economics

- when should vertical integration occur?
- theory about the scope of the firm
  - Oliver Williamson (Nobel Prize 2009)
- Transaction costs
  - associated with economic exchanges
  - negotiating, monitoring, enforcing contracts
  - associated with outsourcing
- Administrative costs
  - associated with organizing within a hierarchy
  - bureaucracy, weak incentives, sclerotic
  - associated with vertical integration

Comparative Organizational Analysis

- De-link two issues
  - what is the objective? what market power resources, efficiencies, etc are
    being sought?
  - what organizational form (outsourcing or vertical integration) best achieves
    the objective?

Make or buy? Core ideas

- for any objective, there is a way to achieve it by either
  - vertical integration (make)
  - or by the market (outsourcing, buy)
- "all organizational forms are flawed" - Williamson
  - examine the relative (dis)advantages
- Williamson's main mantra:
  - markets (ie outsourcing) provide better adaptation
  - hierarchies (ie vertical integration) provide better coordination

Three key transactions costs

- adverse selection
  - information asymmetries (ex ante: based on forecasts rather than actual
    results)
  - one party has private information about the product or service the other
    does not, or cannot get without a large cost
  - the "Lemons problem" (Akerlof, Nobel Prize 2001) (the used car market)
- moral hazard
  - information asymmetries (ex post: based on actual results rather than
    forecasts)
  - one party has private information about performance that is not measurable
    or contracted for, which leads to abuse
  - "abuse" of a benefit
  - ex:
    - banks and the government bailouts
    - one party reducing service quality if the only thing mentioned in the
      contract is total sales
- hold up problem (Williamson)
  - asset specificity
  - uncertainty and opportunism
  - after the transaction/contract, something changes so that one party gains an
    upper hand and can engage in opportunism
  - opportunism: self-interest seeking, with guile
  - examples:
    - one party has to invest in assets that's specific to the agreement
    - buyer-lock in for a vendor
    - one party vulnerable to exposing their intellectual property or
      competitive advantage to the other, so that over time, that party is no
      longer needed

Three Key Administrative Costs

- Weak incentives
  - expectation of continuity
  - zone of indifference (fiat)
  - orders to an internal unit may come from a variety of sources in a company.
    So more slack is given to performance, compared to an outside supplier
- principal-agent problem
  - owner-manager or manager-subordinate
  - performance is unobservable
  - if performance is unobservable, the performing party will be less responsive
    to maintaining performance
  - akin to moral hazard
- lack of dynamism
  - impossible to "selectively intervene"
  - hard to tell an internal division "you either deliver this performance, or
    you get cut off"

Main takeaway

- when to vertically integrate?
  - no general prescription
  - attributes of "the transaction" are key
  - align "governance mode" with these attributes
- reasons to vertically integrate
  - investment in specific assets
  - technology leakage hazards
  - difficult to measure performance of partner
- reasons to outsource
  - need strong incentives
  - more adaptation over time

### Horizontal Scope Part 1

Horizontal Scope & Diversification

- which products/services (businesses) should a company operate in?
- should the same company be integrated across a set of businesses?

Diversification: an example

- A business school as part of a diversified university such as UofI? Versus a
  stand-alone business school?
- advantages?
  - opportunity to connect with faculty in other departments
  - interdisciplinary learning, research, cross-domain
  - generate new ideas by joining experts across fields
  - more diversity in the students, the faculty
- disadvantages?
  - less focus, focus more difficult
  - resources may get diverted to meet general needs
  - students can get lost in a large pool

Horizontal Scope Terminology

- horizontal mergers
  - merging with another company in the exact same industry
  - ex: two automobile insurance companies
- diversification: a wide horizontal scope

Unrelated vs related diversification

- corporate conglomerates = collections of unrelated businesses
  - 1960/70's quite common in the US
  - still quite popular in much of developing world
  - 80s: conglomerates fell apart. Archetypal story told in "Wall Street" <-
    movie 1987 of somebody going around breaking up conglomerates to create more
    value

### Horizontal Scope Part 2

BCG Growth-Share Matrix (1970s)

- developed by Boston Consulting Group for their client, GE
- idea:
  - corporations should be active in industries in various stages of development
    (nascent, growing, mature, etc)
  - create a balanced portfolio of SBU (Strategic Business Units)
- strategy in a two-dimensional space
  - dimensions: market growth (vertical), market share (horizontal)
  - low market growth
    - low market share: "Dog". Cashflow neutral/negative. Strategy
      harvest/divest
    - high market share: "Cash Cow". Cashflow high & stable. Strategy hold.
  - high market growth
    - low market share: "Question Mark". Cashflow negative. Strategy increase
      market share or harvest/divest.
    - high market share: "Star". Cashflow neutral. Strategy hold or invest for
      growth.
- How was value created by these conglomerates?
  - shared management tools
    - accounting, financial analysis, frameworks
    - allowed conglomerates to manage businesses "professionally" when that was
      less accessible by others
  - redeployment of resources from one SBU to another
  - effectively, conglomerates acted as their own bankers, which was more useful
    when the financial markets were less developed (and still is in some of the
    developing world)

Using the BCG Matrix

- dogs: generally will be divested to raise cash
- stars:
  - the future of the company, invest in these
  - eventually will mature into cash cows
- cash cows: yesterday's stars. Don't invest, use the cash from here to power
  others.
- question marks: either invest or divest, depends on the details and risks

Example conglomerate ITT Corporation

- sold telephone equipment pre 1950s
- 1950s onward, started to diversity widely into unrelated businesses
  - insurance (hartford)
  - hotels (sheraton)
  - car rentals (avis)
- "Telephones, hotels, insurance - it's all the same. If you know the numbers
  inside out, you know the company inside out." -- CEO Harold Geneen
- feel apart because
  - discovered specialized management needed for each business
  - general management principles became more widely known, understood
  - corporate headquarters staff got bloated, wasn't adding value
  - incentive to maximize performance in each business faded
  - early 1980's started selling off divisions
  - continued selling off through the 1990s

ITT 2011 Breakup

- company finally split into three
  - water tech: Xylem (a cash cow)
  - defense: Exelis (a cash cow)
  - engineered parts: (the new) ITT (a "star")
- why split off your most profitable divisions?
- "The only unforgivable sin in business is to run out of cash." -- former CEO
  from 1960's, Harold Geneen (would not have supported the breakup)
- stock market response
  - ITT stock jumped 20% (even though they lost their cash cows) Created a few
    billion dollars of wealth!
- but how will the new ITT finance itself? answer coming

Comparative Organization

- two modes for ITT's businesses (SBUs) to operate
  - in one company, with internal cash transfers
  - as separate companies, using financial markets for investing and raising
    cash
- which one is more efficient? Why?
  - (modern, first world) financial markets allocate cash more efficiently
  - diversified firms have bureaucratic inefficiencies

### Horizontal Scope Part 3

Diversification and Performance

- from modern research
- graph of diversification (x-axis) and performance (y-axis)
  - single firms -> dominant firms (slight increase in performance)
  - dominant firms -> related diversified firms (flat line performance)
  - related diversified firms -> unrelated diversified firms (sharp drop in
    performance)
- terminology
  - dominant firms: a horizontally related diversified firm that gets most of
    its revenue from one core product/service
- takeaway:
  - highest performance achieved by related diversification

Breaking up Conglomerates (1980s)

- diversification discount: value of a diversified firm is less than its SBUs
  separately
- Gecko's strategy (from "Wall Street" movie): Create value by taking over and
  breaking up conglomerates with a diversification discount
- used leverage buyouts to buyout the conglomerates

The one US conglomerate left: General Electric

- slowly unwinding
- stock market darling of the 1980s and 90s
- CEO Jack Welch
  - managed to survive as conglomerate by shedding excesses of the model: shrunk
    corporate headquarters dramatically
  - sharp focus: each SBU must be or be on a path to be number 1 or 2 in their
    industry, or they will be divested
- 2008 financial crash hit it hard, struggling to maintain model
- (not in lecture) Nov 2021: GE breaking up into 3 companies: aviation, health
  care, and energy

Motivations for Diversification

- market power
  - reducing competition from related products/services
    - but antitrust concerns?
    - ex: pizza chain buys a fast food chain to avoid their competition
    - often doesn't really work
- synergies: essentially economies of scope
  - Generally the only good reason to diversify
  - scale common resources: brands, IT systems, etc
    - in the old conglomerates: general management capabilities (now widely
      available)
  - redeploy slack resources: supply chain, distribution, talent, etc
    - in the old conglomerates: allocation of cash (now widely available via
      financial markets)
- reduce risks
  - aligns with manager motivation, but not shareholder
  - shareholders can diversify their portfolios just fine by buying shares of
    other firms
- empire building
  - managers often compensated in relation to the total size of the company they
    manage
  - but not necessarily good for shareholders
- pursue profitable opportunities
  - should be spun off at the earliest possible chance

Comparative organizational analysis

- Williamsonian analysis applied to the multi-business firm
  - delink the objective (market power, synergies, etc) from the organizational
    form that best achieves these objective(s)?
  - consider "market arrangements" (alliances, contracts, etc) as alternatives
    to integration

Interview with Mark Moran, Director at John Deere

- why have you diversified in some areas, but not others?
- 1980's - not diversified at all, crises hit farm equipment, most players
  collapsed
  - after: what things look like a tractor? What things have shared components?
  - mining: not enough overlap
  - partnerships with other manufactures

Comparative Organizational Analysis

- doing it within the firm (integration)
  - advantages
    - command and control (fiat, hierarchical lines of authority)
    - coordination
    - community of knowledge
  - disadvantages
    - low-powered incentives
    - principal-agent problem
    - administrative costs
- doing it via the markets (outsourcing)
  - advantages
    - high-powered incentives
    - flexibility
  - disadvantages
    - search costs
    - opportunism (hold-up problem)
    - incomplete contracting (specifying and measuring performance, information
      asymmetries: lemons problem)
    - enforcement of contracts
    - administrative costs

Implications for horizontal scope

- diversification must satisfy two key tests (to be a good idea):
  - the better-off test: does the combination of businesses create value (do
    synergies exists)?
  - the ownership test: to access this value, does the same company need to own
    the businesses? (use comparative organizational analysis)

Resources and Relatedness

- resources are often critical for synergies
  - if they are firm-specific (not available in the market)
  - may be scaled or redeployed across businesses
- relatedness in diversification implies relatedness in the underlying
  firm-specific resources

### Managing Integrated Firms

Broad approach so far

- separate benefits sought from governance modes
- integration as an alternative to "market forms"
- use comparative organizational analysis

Strategy extends beyond make-buy

- why haven't Pepsico and Coca-Cola always owned their bottlers?
- How do Pepsico and Coca-Cola manage independent bottlers, or their integrated
  bottling business?

Beyond Diversification

- how should Alphabet (Google) and Amazon manage units that could easily be
  independent companies?
  - should be given lots of independence
  - or: AMZ acquiring Whole Foods helps them develop their online grocery
    business

Diversification Approaches vary

- more autonomous to more coordinated
  - even market incentives can be replicated to a degree
- approach depends on the nature of the synergies
  - resource scaling (or sharing): require more coordination and more operating
    control of units
  - resource redeployment (or transferring): allow more autonomy and financial
    control of units (like cash between SBUs in the old conglomerate)
    - ex: GE - managerial talent gets redeployed between SBUs

The gradient between "better adaptation" to "Better Coordination"

- buy (less integrated, more autonomy, adaptation)
  - spot market transactions
  - short-term contracts
- strategic alliances
  - relational contracts: licensing, franchising, contractual alliances
  - equity alliances
  - joint ventures
- make (more integrated, more coordination, more control)
  - autonomous SBUs
  - coordinated SBUs

Conclusion

- corporate scope: vertical and horizontal scope
- comparative organizational analysis: a spectrum of choices
- adaptation (markets) versus coordination (hierarchies)
- diversification discount and premium, relatedness, and resources
- BCG matrix and the history of conglomerates
