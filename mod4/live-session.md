## Competitive Advantage: Starbucks Case

- one key resource or capability you identified for Starbucks that is both
  valuable and rare (apply VRI framework)
- my answers:
  - the ubiquitous "third space", available nearly wherever you are
  - supply chain at scale
- prof highlights:

  - resources: things that look like assets
    - brands
    - number of stores
    - human capital
    - relationships with growers
  - third space, ethically sourced coffee, vertical integration
    - examples of more of a strategy: supply the third space
    - resources are what underlies that strategy that allows them to deliver on
      that strategy
  - brand
    - what feelings does the brand convey?
      - depends on where, and who, obviously
      - for most consumers, feelings of calm, comfortable
      - a consistently good experience, always pretty high
      - international markets: high-end, quality
    - is the brand rare?
      - not the only brand
      - high-end brands exist as well
      - starbucks the best-known one
      - markets will have a limit to how many brands can be accommodated
      - rarity rarely absolute for brands, more a degree
    - imitation of their brand
      - what are the barriers?
      - can't do a straight knock-off, at least in the third world
      - to reproduce the brand, long painful process: delivery a consistent cup
        of coffee, ethically, all over the place for years and years. And
        advertise and make sure public knows you're doing it
    - durability of the brand
      - if customers no longer use the 3rd space, they'll loose that association
        in the brand, and the brand value will degrade
      - missteps could kill their brand quickly
      - lack of advertising
    - relevance of the brand
      - changing consumer preferences, the third space no longer possibly so
        relevant (and covid!)
      - in general: use the PESTEL framework to look at how the
        macro-environment is changing, how that effects the resource
      - next generation may not think well of any large corporation brand
      - next generation may have higher standards for ESG-stuff: ex:
        unionization, which would mess up other parts of their business model

- VRI process/analysis
  - looks at each resource or capability at a time
  - then combine across resources, capabilities and look for commonalities

## Generic Strategies & Strategic Renewal

- Cost Leadership (broad cost)
- Focused low cost (narrow cost)
- differentiation (broad value)
- focused differentiation (narrow value)

- cost leaders:
  - satisfy on quality
  - invest heavily on saving costs
- differentiators:
  - satisfy on cost
  - invest heavily on quality, differentiation

What is Starbucks' generic strategy?

- my answer:
  - broad differentiation
  - differentiation because they charge a premium over other offerings
  - broad because they sell coffee, food, wine, etc etc
- prof
  - differentiation
    - proof: Howard Schultz coming back to the company as CEO, basically to
      restore the focus on differentiation, and to put costs back to a backseat
  - broad
    - narrow differentiators offer something only some customers will like, or
      are ultra-premium
      - ex: blue bottle, a Brazilian coffee shop in Illinois
    - broad differentiators sell generally high quality, appeal to mass market

Cost drivers

- the cost drivers
  - scale / scope economies
  - input costs
  - production techniques
  - product design
  - capacity utilization
  - organizational or managerial inefficiency
- big firms generally have an advantage in all of these expect organizational
  and managerial efficiency

Differentiation Value Drivers

- common value drivers
  - product features
  - customer service
  - customization
  - complements
- delivering value (and cost)
  - activities, resources, capabilities

Generic Strategies: Team Exercise

- Hostess Brands: Maker of Twinkies
  - costs per unit:
    - marketing: ~15%
    - logistics: ~30%
    - ingredients: ~15%
    - packaging: ~15%
    - manufacturing: ~25%
    - (operating) profit of <5% !
- compare to little debbie
  - profit per unit ~15%
  - lower costs all around than hostess
  - cost leader
- compare to Entenmanns, Sara Lee
  - profits of ~10% or ~15%
  - similar costs to Hostess, but able to charge higher price
  - differentiators

Breakout: What should Hostess do?

- Hostess is stuck in the middle!
  - brand has allow the company to be crappy with cost for a long time
  - brand is/has decayed, but costs have remained high
- overall strategy Hostess should pursue?
  - my answer: differentiation
- specific steps you would recommend that Hostess Brands takes
  - my answers
    - viral marketing campaign capitalizing on what's left for the Twinkie brand
    - iterate on packaging
    - consider pairing with other brands that have sentimental appeal, bundled
      products
    - narrow and focus just down on Twinkies
- prof vs prof debate (one prof for each perspective)
  - differentiation
    - brand: best resource!
    - invest in marketing
    - differentiation offering: limited edition flavors
    - celebrity endorsements
    - customer love, contests, rewards, etc
    - premium products in other markets: twinkie ice cream!
  - cost leadership
    - extending brand to other products: a mountain of work, very hard!
    - hard to appeal to the modern health-focused consumer
    - the product will always be sinful, and the customer base always a limited
    - narrow cost leadership!
    - focus just on twinkies
    - partner with large retailers: walmart, costco
  - takeaways:
    - no right answer. Both can be argued
    - can do experiments to test out hypothesises: for example, try a brand
      extension and see how it goes
    - but don't try to do both. Very hard and unusual to get right.

Takeaways

- generic strategies
- cost leadership vs differentiation
- dual strategy generally a fool's errand

Midterm

- not really just checking facts
- looking for application
