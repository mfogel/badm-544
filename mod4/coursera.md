## Module 4 Introduction

Strategic fit & Internal Analysis

- in what ways can the firm be aligned with its environment?
- how to "readjust" the alignment when it is lost?

Key topics

- positioning: generic business strategies
  - cost leadership and differentiation
  - broad and narrow scope
- dual or integrated strategies
  - "stuck in the middle" problem
- strategic renewal
  - dynamic capabilities

## 4-1 Generic Business Strategies

### 4-1.1 Generic Business Strategies

Two main generic business strategies, each can be broad or narrow in application

- Cost Leadership
  - similar product at lower cost
  - broad: cost leadership
    - ex: walmart
  - narrow: focused low cost
- Differentiation Advantage
  - price premium from unique product
  - broad: differentiation
  - narrow: focused differentiation
    - example: nordstrom

Cost Leadership & Differentiation

- value (V) perceived by customer
- cost (C) incurred in delivering value
- economic value added EVA
- differentiation: focus on delivering customer value
- cost leadership: focus on controlling costs

Drivers of cost advantage

- scale/scope economies
  - specialization, large batch sizes, indivisible costs, common inputs
- input costs
  - raw material sources, location, supplier relationships/bargaining
- production techniques
  - automation, total quality management, reducing waste
- product design
  - design variety and complexity, design for manufacturing, efficient materials
    use
- capacity utilization
  - amortization of high fixed cost assets, filing spare capacity
- organizational or managerial inefficiency
  - slow decision making, inertia, bureaucracy, hierarchy, politics

Differentiation value drivers

- identifying customers value drivers
  - market research & company insights
- common value drivers
  - product features
  - customer service
  - customization
  - complements
- delivering value
  - activities, resources, capabilities

Positioning and competitive scope

- broad vs narrow target market
- applies to both cost leadership and differentiation

Differentiation and narrow scope

- focused differentiation advantage
  - narrow scope and differentiation are often a natural fit
  - promotes exclusivity, contains costs

Cost leadership and narrow scope

- focused cost leadership
  - scale and economies may not matter
  - avoid customer segments or channels that are too costly to serve
  - serving all customers undermines low cost model
- examples
  - checkers/rally's: fast food only by drive through
  - ikea: only sell to customers that are willing to self-assemble furniture
  - geico: only sell by phone/internet, no agents

What did we learn?

- Strategic positioning using generic business strategies
  - cost leadership or differentiation advantage
  - broad or focused in each
- Identify cost or value drivers
  - apply activities, resources, and capabilities to achieve intended strategy

### Executive Expertise: Strategic Positioning

How is your company strategically positioned in the marketplace - what mix of
cost vs differentiation and broad vs narrow scope does it use? Why?

Sean Chou, Fieldglass

- never low price offering, always in the top half
- feature wars with competitors, tried to avoid but sometimes did happen
  - someone is always going to have a better feature
- stickiness of platform was high
- different industries responded to different parts of offering
  - found value in different parts of the product
  - none looking for lowest cost

Kurt Bock, Country Fnancial

- avoid the undifferentiated middle
- want to be efficient, but never going to get as low-cost as Gieco
- some value add, some differentiation
- compete against large player cost plays
  - hit their target market hard, emphasize their value-add: advice
- guilty of doing many things, going perhaps too broad
- the challenge of being low-cost differentiation: end up in the dead middle
  - avoiding it: going for the highest levels of customer satisfaction
  - must stay focused on not getting into price wars

Al Goldstien, Avant

- focused on differentiation
- never going to be the cheapest alternative
- but going to provide more value to the customer
- not a bank, never going to have as low a cost of capital as them

## 4-2 Dual Strategies

### 4-2.1 Dual Strategies

Dual (Integrated) Strategies

- simultaneously:
  - raise customer value
  - lower costs
- is it feasible? Traditionally accepted answer
  - No!
  - must emphasize either cost leadership or differentiation
  - must avoid being "stuck in the middle"
  - Example: Saab
    - dedicated following in the 60's (via differentiation)
    - but then in the 90's began to loose its differentiated positioning
    - GM had acquired a 50% stake in Saab in 1989
      - pushed to build cars on a common GM platform to cut costs
      - 1994 Saab 900 on Opel Asta platform
      - surge of demand for pre-GM Saabs
    - GM acquires rest of Saab in 2000
    - Bankruptcy in Dec 2011
    - Bought by investment group
    - What happened?
      - GM tried to cut costs
      - but required changes made Saab loose its differentiation
      - without differentiation, no additional customer value, race to the
        bottom

Why is Dual Advantage difficult?

- fundamental forces work against dual advantages
  - strategy involves tradeoffs, tradeoffs, and tradeoffs (Porter, 1997)
  - creating differentiation works against reducing costs, and vice versa
- "Stuck in the middle" problem
  - dual strategy can become incoherent
  - leads to competitive disadvantage

Is dual advantage feasible? How?

- may be a significant opportunity
- how to avoid being "stuck in the middle"?
  - manage cost-differentiation tradeoffs
  - significant managerial innovation
- some successful examples
  - dell: custom manufacturing
  - Honda/Toyota: total quality management (differentiation and cost control)
- requires clear disciplined strategy

What did we learn

- dual strategy is difficult
  - cost versus differentiation tradeoffs
  - "stuck in the middle" problem
- dual advantage may be feasible
  - managerial innovation needed
  - clear, disciplined way of managing cost-differentiation tradeoffs

## 4-3 Strategic Renewal

### 4-3.1 Strategic Renewal

Why Strategic Renewal?

- ex: Circuit City
  - great success 1982 - 2000
  - had a differentiated Advantage
    - customer service
    - leading edge logistics
  - but filed for bankruptcy in 2008
    - big box stores and internet retailers
    - shares buy-back, laid off thousands of salespeople

Internal Decline -> Strategic Misalignment <- Environmental Change

- ex: nokia
- ex: blackberry
- ex: Kodak

Dynamic Capabilities

- capabilities that enable a company to change resources or capabilities
  - "higher order" capabilities
  - change how a company survives or performs
  - contrast with operational capabilities
- examples: capabilities for
  - conducting acquisitions
  - alliances
  - new product development
  - business development
  - organizational transformation

3P Dynamic Capabilities Framework

- Processes: well-developed activities and routines
- Positions: Resources owned or available
- Paths: Opportunities, strategic options

Dynamic Capabilities: an illustration

- Kodak - unable to adapt to digital cameras, collapsed
- FujiFilm - was able to pivot into other fields, doing well now

Module Conclusion

- cost leadership vs differentiation
  - narrow vs broad scope
- dual advantage strategy
  - risks being "stuck in the middle"
  - needs clarity and discipline
- strategic renewal
  - loss of strategic alignment
  - 3P Dynamic capabilities framework

### Executive Expertise: Strategic Renewal

Did your company make a significant strategic pivot at any time? Why? How do you
do this successfully?

- takeaway: startups can pivot, big companies have a hard time
- Kurt Bock, Country Financial
  - need to capitalize on how well they know their customers
  - cognitive dissonance (don't understand something in the market) can cause
    companies to ignore it
  - mentioned some places they don't perform, and that they need to find a way
    to do so
- Al Goldstein, Avant
  - companies have to change strategic positioning over time
  - avoid the sunk cost fallacy
  - a lot of minor pivots as a startup
  - company of owners in a startup
- Sean Chou, Fieldglass
  - early days - strategic renewal all the time as you find product-market fit
  - once you are a market leader, the whole picture changes
  - don't want to be pivoting reactively, rather in an additive manner

### The Manager's Journey: Advice from Our Experts

What advice would you give aspiring managers about how they can be effective
strategic leaders?

- Al Goldstein, Avant
  - the difference between success and failure is making a few critical
    decisions at the right time. It's not the day-to-day.
  - judgement of what deserves your time to focus on, hard to figure out what
    decisions are the critical ones
  - humility: I don't think I'm a very good manager. I don't have the discipline
    some others do. Know yourself.
  - understand everybody's strengths & weaknesses, especially your own.
  - spend a lot of time listening, and encouraging discussion.
- Sean Chou, Fieldglass
  - have a big dream, a big picture of what you're solving
  - a lot of people lack a tactical plan on how to get there
  - data to show if your experiments are successful or not
  - lowest cost to test your thesis: fake it before you make product commitments
  - be merciless about killing the things that aren't producing results
  - admit when you're wrong. Admit it openly and fast.
  - spend a lot of time talking to customers, stay close
- Kurt Bock, Country Financial
  - knowing that you're not perfect
  - a strategic leader is a great listener
  - a leader that takes care of the people under them. Inverted pyramid.
  - education key to spread perspective, knowledge
  - never think you know everything, always look for knowledge
  - if you think you're right, you're not
